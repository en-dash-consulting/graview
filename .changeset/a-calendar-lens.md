A calendar lens: month, week, day and agenda over real dates. `createCalendarLens` binds a kind's own fields to roles — a start date or date-time, an optional end, an all-day flag, a label, a done flag — the way every other starter does, and `graview check` reads the binding like the others'. Multi-day spans are drawn on every day they cover and say which piece they are; a busy month cell says "+N more" and opens that day; all-day entries sort before timed ones; done reads as done. All date arithmetic is on `YYYY-MM-DD` strings in UTC, so an entry does not land on the 13th for half the world, and `addMonths("2026-01-31", 1)` is February.

Two framework capabilities the calendar forced. `ViewState.within` is where a view says where it is INSIDE itself — `in.at=2026-10-01&in.range=month` — carried in the fragment, never read by the framework, and counted as travelling rather than as an adjustment, so Back returns to the month you left. And a kind may now have SEVERAL pictures: `places()` lists every titled group view, each with an `as` slug the stop names (`in.view=the-month`), and `resolve(kind, cell, as)` picks one. Before this, registering a second titled view simply replaced the first and made it unreachable.

Also: a control inside a view no longer selects the card it is drawn on — pressing the calendar's "next" used to select every task in the district behind it.

Things shows a month over tasks by due date beside the week and the lists, all three now the framework's own named places rather than a switcher of its own. Seedbed gains a season over plantings, which means a planting now records the day it was harvested and is a span rather than a dot.
