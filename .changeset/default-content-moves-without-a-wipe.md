Default content moves without a wipe. The step DSL gains five content steps beside the schema ones — `put-node`, `patch-node`, `drop-node`, `put-edge`, `drop-edge` — each judged against the stored graph at the moment it runs, so a record already there is not put twice and a patch that changes nothing says nothing. `primitivesForSteps` now runs steps IN SEQUENCE, each seeing the graph as the ones before it leave it, which is what the studio already assumed when it renamed a kind and then spoke of its fields by the new name, and what a content run needs to put a record and tie it in one breath.

`seedSteps(seed, live)` diffs a bootstrap seed against a live snapshot into those steps — missing records put, fields the seed sets patched, missing ties made, and nothing dropped unless `prune` is asked for by name — and `applySteps(store, steps)` lands them as ONE operation authored `system · ship:sync-seed`, logged with its inverse, so undo is the ordinary undo. `graview sync-seed <entry> --seed <file> [--data|--sqlite] [--apply] [--prune] [--json]` is the command: it prints the steps as sentences and writes nothing until `--apply`. The seed is read once, into an empty store, and the README now says so; `fresh` is a demo's way back to the example, not the redesign tool.

`graview serve` and `sync-seed` parse their store flags through one `backendFrom`, and `loadApp` is exported from `@graview/core/cli` so the packages that load an entry load it the same way.
