A migration is data, and the studio writes it. `stepsMigration({ from, to, steps })` in `@graview/ship` turns declared steps — a kind gone or renamed, a field dropped or started, an edge removed or MOVED — into primitives against the stored graph when it opens; a moved edge is carried to the records of its new kind tied to each old end (a gardener who tended a plot tends each planting in it). The studio's `migrationSteps` sees a relation declared on another kind as a move, says it before Apply, and writes it into the app's `defineApp` through the studio door (`add-migration`: the version moved on, the migration appended, its import added), so a stored graph is carried forward, logged and undoable, the next time it opens.
