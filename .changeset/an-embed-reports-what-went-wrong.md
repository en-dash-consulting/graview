An embed reports what went wrong and how long it took, without what was on screen. `mount` and `@graview/embed/pages` take `onError(error, { module, face })` and `onReady({ ms, face })`. Each face, the strip and the studio's place on it draw behind a boundary: what throws says it could not draw and offers to try again, and the rest of the embed keeps working, so a page that throws leaves the strip and the scene a press away. The host is told the error's class (`EmbedError`) and the framework module that caught it, never the message, which may quote a record. A view's own boundary in the scene reports the same way: `ViewBoundary` tells the `ErrorReportContext` above it, which `@graview/react` exports. `onReady` is told once, after the first render, how many milliseconds it took (FR-24).

Compatibility: additive — `onError`, `onReady`, `EmbedError`, `EmbedErrorWhere`, `EmbedReady`, `ErrorReport` and `ErrorReportContext` are new, and a view that throws with no report above it is said on the console as before. Ops, stored formats, the wire, the declaration and derived tools are unchanged.
