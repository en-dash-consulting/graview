The framework spells in American English. The code, the sentences it says to a person and to a model, the comments, the docs, the skills and the test names had drifted into British spelling in some four hundred files, so one thing had two names, and an export spelled one way was an import a stranger got wrong the other way. Every one is now American: color, center, behavior, judgment, labeled, canceled, catalog, gray, normalize, and the rest of their kind. What the platform and third parties own keeps their spelling: `aria-labelledby`, the status Google Calendar gives a deleted event and MCP's `notifications/cancelled`. Published changelogs and Graview Cloud's documents among the test fixtures are kept as written. A test at the root, `tests/the-repo-spells-in-american-english.test.ts`, reads every tracked source, doc, skill and changeset for the British forms and names the file and line of any it finds, so the drift does not come back.

Compatibility: renamed outright, with no aliases. `@graview/core` exports `normalize` (was `normalise`), `summarize` (was `summarise`), `humanizeField` (was `humaniseField`), `colorsIn` (was `coloursIn`) and `connectorHueColor` (was `connectorHueColour`). `@graview/primitives` exports `humanize` (was `humanise`). `@graview/react` and `@graview/react/provider` export `honorSetting` (was `honourSetting`). In the declaration, a setting says `honored` (was `honoured`), a brand's connector kit says `color` (was `colour`, in `brand.kit.connectors.all` and `byEdge`), as does a `checkKitContrast` finding, and an invariant written in the rule language carries `judgment` (was `judgement`). Two check finding codes are renamed: `kit-color-unreadable` (was `kit-colour-unreadable`) and `setting-not-honorable` (was `setting-not-honourable`). The scene's CSS custom property `--graview-center-y` was `--graview-centre-y`. Sentences said to a person or a model that used a British form now use the American one. Ops, stored formats, the document format, wire messages and tool names and schemas are unchanged.
