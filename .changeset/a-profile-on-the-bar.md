A profile on the bar. `<Profile>` is the one place that answers "who am I signed in as" and holds what belongs to the reader rather than to the installation: their own record (where an installation is declared), the seat switcher, the settings, and the scheme. Settings are declared — `app.settings`, drawn by the pane, honoured by the provider, and checked: `graview check` refuses a setting nothing can apply, one with nothing to choose between, one that opens on an answer it does not offer, two that share a name, and a root font size that is not a length. `readerSettings()` is the two every app should offer (text size and motion); `applySettings` carries them at the edge so an app's two faces agree.

Two bugs surfaced underneath. The theme set `font: 0.875rem` on `html, body` — so the ROOT's own size became 0.875 of the browser's, every `rem` in the framework resolved against 14px instead of 16, and the one place a text-size setting can live was already occupied. The body is sized now; the root is left exactly as the reader has it, and "As your browser has it" stamps nothing rather than guessing. And `usePickTargets` stamped `role="button"` on every pick target including landmark elements, which ARIA forbids — three `<header role="button">` on the first screen of the demo, unnoticed because nothing had run axe over the scene. The role is now stamped only where it is legal; a target that cannot take it still gets `tabindex`. Motion is overridable by the reader: the stylesheet's reduced-motion rules are emitted once for the system's preference and once for `data-graview-motion="reduce"`, scoped so an embed honours a host's answer without restyling the host.
