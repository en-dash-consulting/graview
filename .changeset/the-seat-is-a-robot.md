The seat is a robot in the city: it stands where it reads and writes, comes to your cursor when asked, and says its refusals at the gate. One figure per agent participant (`kind:id:session`, the op log's own key), drawn by an `Occupants` overlay over the stage on both renderer paths and positioned from the live frame through `whereIs`, so it rides the tween and the pan and never enters `layout()`. Where it stands is a pure fold (`foldRobots`, tested like `markActivity`): a read puts it at what it read, a write at what it wrote, more than four targets at the neighbourhood, a refusal at the gate with the policy's words as its say, a question on the node's doorstep, rest after the hold at its dock — the seated person's own building when the installation is shown, else a pad at the city's origin cell. Movement is one CSS transition on transform; a quiet city runs no loop and no pointer listener, and reduced motion makes moves instant.

The tab's one-press seat and its chat are ONE robot: the seat registers its name and the chat writes as it (and is seated even while the Activity rail is shut, so the body is docked from the first frame). Applying a plan walks it to each target before the op lands (`applyPlan`'s `before`); undoing an agent's turn walks it home; a run's stop sentence, announced through `onCall`, is said from its bubble. Click the figure, or Tab to it and press Space, and it follows the pointer, offset so it never sits under the cursor; while following, "this" in the chat is the pick under the pointer and the chat panel is anchored as its bubble; Escape releases from anywhere. Off the visible ground an edge indicator points at it with its status line. The bubble is a polite live region carrying whatever the seat says on its rung, and the figure is a named button. `scripts/verify-robot.mjs` drives all of it on the todo app; the seat harness still shows identical diffs.

Also: the graph responder now fills a choice argument from the option's own word in the sentence ("give a role keeper to Sam"), and only when exactly one option is named.
