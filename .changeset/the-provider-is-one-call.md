The decision provider itself. `jevDecide({ apiKey | baseUrl, … })` in `@graview/tools` is one `Decide`: one state and a MAP of typed questions in, typed answers under the same keys out — so a node's whole unset half is one request rather than one per field. 429 and 529 are retried with backoff (injectable); 401 is thrown as the SEAT's problem and 422 as OURS, each said in those words, because blaming the model for a bug in the derivation would send somebody looking in the wrong place. An answer that is not typed, or missing, is refused rather than guessed. The key is read from the environment by `jevKeyFromEnvironment()` — `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, then `JEV_API_KEY` — travels in one header, and appears in no error. Usage is metered per call and in total (`onUsage`), and `jevCostUsd` prices input tokens at the published rate; output is unmetered.

A browser must not hold a service key, so `@graview/ship/dev` gains `decisionBridge()`: a dev-server door at `DECISION_BRIDGE_PATH` (`/__graview/decide`) that holds the key from the server's own environment, forwards a page's state and questions, and hands the provider's own status back so the page-side provider tells failures apart the same way. Same-origin only; the key is in no response. The contract (`DecisionBridgeStatus`, `DecisionBridgeAsk`, `DecisionBridgeAnswer`) lives in `@graview/core` beside the local door's.
