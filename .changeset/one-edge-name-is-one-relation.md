One edge name is one relation. `graview check` refuses `edge-name-shared` when the same edge name is declared on two kinds in different words — `by` on a song ("their songs") and on an album ("their releases") put an artist's songs and releases together under whichever came first, on the card, the record and the captions. Declaring a name from several kinds in the same words stays legal. `edgeAllowed` now judges an edge against the declaring kind's own targets rather than the first declaration's, and `schema.edge(name).to` is every declaration's targets. The studio's grant edge is `allows-on` (it shared `over` with the rule, so a kind's page listed its grants as rules), and the `graview-node-kind` skill names the check.
