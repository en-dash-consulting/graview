A tool's schema does not depend on zod's minor version. An agent tool's input schema is a stability surface, and zod writes its own regex for a string format — `z.email()`, `z.uuid()`, `z.iso.datetime()`, `z.iso.date()` — beside the format's name. That regex differs between zod 4.4.3, which this repository locked, and 4.6.5, which a consumer resolves from the published ranges, so Cloud's tool-schema snapshot saw sixteen "inputSchema changed" entries that were only zod's regex. `toJsonSchema`, and with it `mutationToolSchema`, `nodeJsonSchema`, `schemaJson` and the conformance kit's tools, now says a format string by its JSON-schema `format` alone (`email`, `uri`, `uuid`, `date-time`, `date` …) and drops zod's `pattern`; a pattern the author wrote with `.regex(…)` is kept, beside the format where there is one. Moving the workspace to zod 4.6.5 found a second dependence on zod's internals: zod 4.6 no longer fills a schema's `_zod.bag` as it builds it, so `describeArg` lost a number's bounds and a date's pattern, and a date argument was asked for as free text. It now reads the checks on the definition, which both versions keep. Every package's zod range is now `^4.6.5`, so the tests run on what a consumer gets.

Compatibility: tool input schemas — a format-based string no longer carries zod's regex `pattern`, only its `format` (an `email` property is `{ "type": "string", "format": "email" }`); a `z.url()` property is unchanged, and an author-written pattern is kept. A snapshot of a tool surface taken with either zod version changes once, for those properties only, and then holds across zod minors. The conformance kit's recorded fixtures are unchanged: none declares a format string, and the lock holds. `describeArg` and `argShape` answer as they did on zod 4.4 for every schema, now on 4.6 too. Every package's `zod` dependency moves from `^4.4.3` to `^4.6.5` (products never install zod; `@graview/core` re-exports it). The embed's bundle budgets rise with zod 4.6, which gives every schema type its own JSON-schema processor: the pages face alone from 815,000 / 220,000 to 950,000 / 252,000 bytes and every face from 1,150,000 / 330,000 to 1,290,000 / 362,000 (minified / gzipped), about 130 kB / 30 kB of zod's that a host on zod 4.6 was already paying. The document format, ops, stored formats, the wire and check codes are unchanged.
