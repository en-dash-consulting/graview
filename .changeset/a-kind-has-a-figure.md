A kind has a figure. `defineNode(kind, { figure })` takes inline SVG — one `viewBox`, `currentColor` strokes, no fill — or the name of one from a small shipped set (person, plot, box, task, shift, list, vehicle, rule, note), and a brand may override any kind's. One `<KindFigure>` draws it everywhere a kind is drawn: the kind card at altitude, the district beside its plural, the routed face's rails and record eyebrows. A kind without one is drawn exactly as before; nothing about a figure is required.

`graview check` refuses a figure that cannot be drawn — no `viewBox` (nothing can size it), a literal colour (invisible in one of the two schemes), nothing stroked with `currentColor` (it will not take the kind's ink), or a name nothing ships — and refuses a brand drawing for a kind the app does not declare. `drawFigure` in `@graview/tools` asks a model for one in the house style and judges the answer with the same function, so a drawing that would fail the build never reaches a person as a proposal; a model that throws or draws badly falls back to the nearest shipped figure BY NAME and says so, because guessing that a cleat is a box would be the framework having an opinion about a domain it has never met. `graview figure <entry> --kind <k>` prints the line to paste.
