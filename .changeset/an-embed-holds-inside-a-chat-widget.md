An embed holds inside a chat's widget. `mount` takes `height: "auto"` and `onIntrinsicHeight`, and tells the host the height it asks for as it changes: the strip and the whole page on the pages face, the strip and the picture's box on the others. It takes `hostContext: { theme }` over the page's own scheme, and `scheme: "auto"` now follows the host page's `data-theme` and the system's preference as they change rather than reading them once. `pagesBelow` gives the scene and the Graview way to the pages face below a width. `remote` takes a store from `openRemote` and its presence. `memory` keeps the reader's settings and the tab's session where the host says, and a frame whose `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` throw still mounts. The routed face no longer asks for a window's height when embedded, which grew a frame sized from its content without end.

Presence speaks one dialect and forgets the gone. `participantKey` and `parseParticipant` name the `kind:id:session` format the op log, the figures and the wire share. What a presence channel reports is dropped once its last word is older than `REMOTE_PRESENCE_TTL_MS`, whether or not the channel says the person left. A people directory (`people` on `mount`, `GraviewProvider` and the pages' context, `Person` in core) names authors in the rail, the pages, the profile and presence without offering anybody a seat, so a hosted reader sees no seat switcher and no "Sit as somebody else"; `nameOfAuthor` reads it after the seats. The handle gains `setPeople`, `setSeats` and `setHostContext` (FR-13).

Compatibility: additive for the wire — `participantKey` writes the key the served store already wrote, and `openRemote` keeps the TTL it had, now named `REMOTE_PRESENCE_TTL_MS`. `EmbedOptions` gains optional `people`, `hostContext`, `remote`, `memory`, `presenceTtlMs`, `onIntrinsicHeight` and `pagesBelow`, and `EmbedHandle` gains `setPeople`, `setSeats` and `setHostContext`, which a host implementing the handle itself must now provide. Changed in meaning: an embed with `scheme: "auto"` follows the host's scheme after mount, and a figure's own name in presence is the one `nameOfAuthor` gives (a seat's label, a directory's name, `Principal.name`) where it was the principal's id. Ops, stored formats, the declaration and derived tools are unchanged.
