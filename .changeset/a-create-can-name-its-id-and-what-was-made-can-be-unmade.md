A create can name its id, and what was made can be unmade. Every act that declares `creates` now takes an optional `id` argument the framework adds beside its own: `compileMutation` lifts it before the declaration's input parses, `freshId` hands it out first, and an id the graph already has is refused by name rather than quietly suffixed — so a seed being synced, or an agent that will refer to the node in its next call, gets exactly the id it asked for or an honest no. The tool schema says so (`mutationToolSchema`), and `takesAnId` says which acts take it.

And every kind gets `remove-<kind>` derived beside `edit-<kind>`: destructive, titled, taking the node and its ties, logged and undoable, permitted through the acts that create the kind or a grant naming it — who may bring a thing into being may take it out, which is narrower than the edit's reading on purpose. An app's own `remove-<kind>` is kept. `derived` on a mutation is now `{ kind, act: "edit" | "remove" }`; `deriveMutations`, `deriveRemoveMutations`, `removeVia` and `derivedVia` join the exports, and the store, the checker, `describe` and `docs` all count the removes with the edits. The refusal for a derived act nothing declared reaches now says "creates or changes" rather than the edit's "writes or creates".
