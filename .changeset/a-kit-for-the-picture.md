A kit for the picture. Everything the scene draws that is not a view — the lines, their captions, the ground's grid and lattice, the kind tags, how far the unlit recedes, the mark a broken rule leaves — is declared on `brand.kit`, any part of it, the rest as shipped. A connector's route is a named strategy (`curve`, `straight`, `orthogonal`) and its stroke a named pattern; each is one case in one file, so the next is one more case and nothing in the scene moves. Colour and visibility are per edge kind under `connectors.byEdge` or for all under `connectors.all`; a kind kept quiet is not drawn and stays selectable from the inspector. `themeCss` emits the kit as `--graview-kit-*` custom properties that the ground and the tags read. `graview check` holds an explicit line colour to 3:1 against both grounds in both schemes (`kit-contrast-below-aa`, `kit-colour-unreadable`). An embed's handle gains `setBrand`, so a page can re-dress a running Graview.
