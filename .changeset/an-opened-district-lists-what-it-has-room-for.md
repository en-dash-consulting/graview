An opened district lists what it has room for, in names you can read. The layout reserved 96 pixels under an opened district and the view listed sixteen members in 250, two columns of ninety-five pixels, under a header whose name column could shrink to nothing: a dealership's Vehicles, opened at the foot of an eight-district city, read "VEHICL291ES" over sixteen chips of "2026 Ma…" running off the scene. The layout now reserves rows (`rosterRows`, `rosterHeight`, `ROSTER_ROW` exported), tells the view how many the city kept room for (`openedRows`, carried through the tween), and the view lists that many in as many columns as the names can be read in (`rosterOf`), with the rest counted. The header wraps its count under the name.
