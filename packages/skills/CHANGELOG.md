## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 964d140: The DOM path is a citizen of every browser. The board no longer trusts
  `height: 100%` to transfer through `aspect-ratio` — Firefox and WebKit
  treated it as indefinite inside the panel's flex chain and collapsed the
  pitch to its border pixels, taking every slot's hit target with it; the
  width now comes from the same ResizeObserver measurement that decides when
  the board turns. The local-AI rung fails fast and says why when a browser
  has no WebGPU, and the chat header carries that reason instead of a shrug.
  The graview-new-app skill states the supported-browsers floor.
- ff01375: A skills package: eight authoring moves, each ending in a real `graview check`
  verdict rather than in a claim, and each saying which part of its own work the
  checker cannot see.
- 587764e: The skills point their worked examples at what this repository ships: the
  todo and seedbed examples and the framework's own tests. The three product
  apps that used to serve as examples — a household week, a bid desk and a
  coaching week — live in their own repositories now, and the port-app skill
  describes the parity fixture that proved the port rather than pointing at
  a path that has moved.
- 34c1600: A product on Graview can be started rather than assembled. `graview create
  <dir>` — and its conventional door, `npm create graview` — writes the project
  the `graview-new-app` skill describes: one declared kind with `creates`,
  `connects`, `writes` and a horizon, one rule that names its repair, an
  eighty-line shell of framework parts, the routed face, persistence in the
  browser, a headless test and a CI workflow; then installs it, installs the
  authoring skills into it, and says what to do next. `--link <path>` makes
  the same project consume the framework from a sibling checkout by path, the
  way the first-party products do, with the one thing that shape needs and
  nothing said about: tsc pointed at a single copy of zod. The generator is
  `@graview/core/scaffold`, a pure function from a name and a first kind to a
  list of files, for a host that provisions apps in-process. The skill now
  begins with the scaffolder. `scripts/smoke-create.mjs` keeps all of it
  honest on every push: scaffold from the packed tarballs, install with no
  workspace, run the project's own `verify`, open it in a real browser, then
  the same by path.
  
  The rehearsal also caught two primitives mixing a `border` shorthand with a
  `borderColor` that came and went across renders — the Standing button and
  the affordance strip — which React reports on every rerender; both now set
  the longhand, and the browser console of a scaffolded app is empty.
  
  A premortem of the first hour closed the gaps between "the harness passes"
  and "a person succeeds": the root `pnpm build` now builds every package a
  linked project resolves types from (pages and ship were missing, so a fresh
  clone could not scaffold); `graview create` refuses a framework that is not
  built and says how to build it, warns when the project would land inside the
  framework's own tree, initialises a repository, and in link mode writes a CI
  workflow that checks the framework out beside the app and builds it first;
  a project declares Node 22, tells pnpm 10 about esbuild's postinstall, and
  runs `check` and `docs` cold; and the README leads with the path that works
  today rather than the one that works once the packages are published.
  
  And the shell is a primitive. `Shell` in `@graview/primitives` is the command
  bar, the scene, the inspector and the rail — with the landmarks assistive
  technology expects, once — so an app supplies a home, a sentence for when
  nothing is wrong, and a seat. The scaffold, the todo example and the empty
  example all use it now instead of carrying eighty drifting lines each.
