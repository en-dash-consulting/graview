### Patch Changes

- a190947: The hosted page has room again, and says what it weighs (FR-104). Graview Cloud's shell is `openRemote` plus the embed over a compiled document. With the columns lens, template labels, currency, walks from a set and the hidden-kind check landed (FR-97 to FR-101, FR-105), it loaded 611 900 bytes (598 KB) of framework before the app drew, against the 600 KB Cloud's brief set. Every new face feature pushed Cloud's budget test over. Measured from esbuild's metafile, 73 KB of what the page loaded up front was code that only a lazily loaded face uses. esbuild gives a whole file to every chunk that can reach it, and the page reaches files through an index. Two levers cut it to 589 079 bytes (575 KB). The first is the theme sheet. It was one stylesheet that the frame of every face drew, and a third of it named only what the scene draws: the districts from altitude, the plots, the village, the roads, the billboards and the bands. Those 87 rules are now `sceneCss` in `@graview/primitives` (and `@graview/primitives/scene`). The scene face draws them after the frame's `themeBaseCss`, inside the embed's box, so a page on the pages face carries none of them. `themeCss` is still the whole sheet: the base, then the scene's rules. That moves the scene's rules after the others, and a test holds that no rule was lost or doubled and that each one names something only the scene draws. This took 15.5 KB off the page and 17.5 KB off the pages face before it draws, and left the scene face unchanged. The embed's own bundle budgets come down with it: the pages face alone is now 495 604 bytes, where it was 511 391, and the embed without the studio is 787 572, where it was 810 223. The second is the frame's `useWidth`, `VISUALLY_HIDDEN` and `descentTarget`, which now come from files of their own. The frame no longer reaches the primitives' index or the scene's way back, which is 6.8 KB more. Cloud's own shell, built from these sources, is 596.0 KB on main and 573.7 KB with this change. The budget claim is now 585 KB: the new figure with 10 KB of headroom, 25 KB under Cloud's 600. `pnpm hosted` also writes docs/hosted-page.md, the weight by package as a table with the headroom and each face's figure before it draws. It also says what the first chunk needs for itself: 509 KB, measured with every door shut. The release step measures the page again and puts the same table under the `graview` and `@graview/embed` GitHub releases. What remains up front that only a door uses is mostly zod's JSON Schema writer (20 KB). It is reached through zod's own index and used by the companion's act tools. The rest is parts of `@graview/core` files reached through its index.
  
  Compatibility: `@graview/primitives/frame` exports `themeBaseCss` in place of `themeCss`. `@graview/primitives` exports `themeCss` as before, and adds `themeBaseCss` and `sceneCss`. Within `themeCss` the scene's rules come after the rest. Each rule weighs what it did, and a harness found no change. `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-104`. Ops, stored formats, wire messages, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 6b7edf9: A declared lens draws (FR-79). A document's `lenses` were accepted and drew nothing, and so were a TypeScript app's: a lens drew only because the app's own UI called `createTimelineLens(…)` and registered the result with a title, so a chat that wrote a lens into a document made something nobody would ever see. A `lenses` entry now takes a `title`, an `on` (the kind it stands on, when its bindings do not say) and data-only `options`, and a shipped lens with a title is a place: a pill on the bar, a drive-in from altitude and a page at `/places/<as>`, registered over each kind it stands on at many × full and many × summary. `declaredLenses(app)` in `@graview/core` decides which lenses draw, with which factory options resolved from the bindings, and why the rest do not; `SHIPPED_LENSES` names the six it maps — `timeline`, `calendar`, `coverage`, `board`, `plan`, `reach` — with their roles and the options each takes. `registerDeclaredLenses(registry, app)` in `@graview/primitives` (and `@graview/primitives/frame`) registers each as a door to the shipped factory, fetched when a lens is first drawn (`fetchDeclaredLenses`), and `declaredViews(app)` is the defaults, the view specs and the declared lenses in one registry. The embed calls it for every app it mounts, so a document's lenses draw with no views at all. What a factory needs that cannot be data is derived: a timeline's columns from the values its `column` field takes (or `options.columns`), its axis words from its extent, a calendar's `today` from the reader's own clock unless `options.today` names one. `graview check` says why a titled lens cannot draw, at its path — `lens-cannot-draw`, `lens-option-unknown`, `lens-title-taken`, `lens-not-shipped`, every one a warning — and a shipped lens needs no `requiredRoles` or `binds` of its own (`requiredRolesOf`, `bindsOf`). `plan` joins the shipped names in the checker and in `graview describe`, which now says which declared lenses draw, over what, at which address, and why a titled one does not. `placesOf(app)` lists every place an app has — the home, each lens, each kind — as `{ slug, title, kind, cardinality, address, stop, lens?, hidden?, first? }`, for a host to list. Apps/todo, apps/rota, apps/gauntlet and apps/discography declare their shipped lenses with titles and register none of them by hand. The studio keeps two lenses of one name apart by their titles. `@graview/primitives/scene` is a new subpath (the companion, the inspector, the places bar), which the embed's scene face and the pages' assistant import so that a face which draws no lens does not carry the six factories; `@graview/primitives/pages` also exports `registerDefaultViews` and `registerViewSpecs`. The bundle budgets for every face and for the studio handed in rise to 1_400_000 / 412_000, and what a page without the studio loads first to 203_000 gzipped, said in `scripts/lib/bundle-budget.mjs`, which now measures from the page's own entry rather than the first chunk esbuild lists. A hosted page carries 563 KB up front. Unit tests compile a document declaring one lens of each shipped type and find each drawn by its title on the embed's bar and at its page, `check` and `describe` agreeing with the one list; `verify-declared` does it in a browser. The `graview-lens` skill says to declare a shipped lens rather than register it. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-79.
  
  Compatibility: the declaration and check finding codes — additive within `graview-document@1`: `title`, `on` and `options` are new optional fields of a `lenses` entry, and `requiredRoles` is optional on `LensDeclaration`. The new codes are warnings, never errors, and a declaration that checked clean before still does; a check's `where` names a titled lens by its title. The wire — `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-79`. Ops, stored formats and tool schemas are unchanged. `ViewRegistry` gains optional `arrange` and `arrangement`, so a hand-built registry needs neither.
- 77a9fdc: A home view from the closed block set (FR-81). The home was always derived, and a document that wrote `views.home` was refused. A declaration's `home` — a document's `views.home`, a list of blocks — is now the home's body on both faces: on the routed face it replaces the derived home under the shell, its first headline the page's `h1`; on the Graview face it stands as a landing over the picture whenever the scene is at home (nothing focused, nothing chosen), at ground level and from altitude, on the side the companion leaves free, put away by going anywhere or by its own button (`HomeLanding` in `@graview/primitives` and `@graview/primitives/scene`, drawn by `Shell` and the embed's scene face). An empty graph still opens on the way in: the home view yields to the beginning until there is a record to show. Three blocks join the set, and work in a card, a row and a page as well as the home: `headline` (a template), `figure` with an expression (`{ figure: "sum(all('package'), net)", as: "number" | "money" | "percent", currency: "USD", label }`; `{ figure: true }` is still the kind's picture), and `list` (`{ list: expr, sort: key | { by, direction: "asc" | "desc" | "choices" }, limit, group: field | { by, headings }, empty, as: "card" | "row" }`), which draws each record with its own card or row spec and makes it a link — a record's address on the routed face (`SpecLinks`), a pick on the scene. Blocks about no one record may not name a bare field and reach records with `all('kind')`; a list's sort key and group are held to the kinds its source reaches. A lens named `blocks` with a title, an `on` and `options.blocks` is a place drawn from the same blocks, so a chat can write a picture with no code (`SHIPPED_LENSES.blocks`). The registry carries the home view beside the places (`registry.home(view)`, `registry.homeView()`), set by `registerDeclaredLenses` and fetched when first drawn (`fetchHomeView`); `graview describe` says the home is drawn from blocks, and the document diff says when the home's look changes. FR-83's gap closes: a kind's `glance` may name a computed field (the card and the list line work it out over the seat's graph), and a `label` or `describe` may name one worked out from the record alone — one that reads beyond the record is refused, since a label is said with no graph in hand. `packages/core/tests/document/fixtures/lifelogics.gdd.json` rebuilds LifeLogics' front page and its four lenses as data; unit tests draw it, and `verify-declared` draws it on both faces at 1440×900 and 390×844 in both schemes. The `graview-pages`, `graview-node-kind` and `graview-lens` skills say how. The bundle budgets rise with measured numbers in `scripts/lib/bundle-budget.mjs`: an embed without the studio to 815_000 / 215_000 (measured 802_562 / 209_988), every face and the studio handed in to 1_430_000 / 424_000 (measured 1_420_964 / 418_572 and 1_414_220 / 413_619); a hosted page carries 584 KB up front, and a face before it draws at most 840 KB (the scene measured 836_810, from 817_424). `capabilities().shipped` names FR-81.
  
  Compatibility: the declaration and check finding codes — additive within `graview-document@1`: `views.home` as a list of blocks, the `headline`, `list` and expression `figure` blocks, and the `blocks` lens are new; `views.<kind>` as an object of slots reads as before, so a kind called `home` keeps its views. A titled lens named `blocks` was a warning before and draws now; what its blocks cannot say is a warning at its path, never an error. A `label`, `describe` or `glance` naming a computed field was an error and is now accepted where it can be said. New codes (`list-sort`, `list-group`, `list-limit`, `list-as`, `list-empty`, `view-currency`) are errors only on blocks that could not compile before. The wire — `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-81`. Ops, stored formats and tool schemas are unchanged. `ViewRegistry` gains optional `home` and `homeView`; `RenderContext` an optional `budget`.
- 6852b7d: `pages` is a real arrangement (FR-80). A document's `pages` was accepted and never compiled, and an app had no way to say what its home shows first or where it opens. `pages: { order?, hide?, first? }` (`PagesArrangement`) is now typed, compiled onto the app, given back by `toDocument`, and honoured on both faces. `order` names kinds in the order the routed face's gallery and nav and the city at altitude take them (`orderKinds`); kinds it leaves out follow as declared. `hide` takes kinds off the home only — their cards and counts — and a hidden kind keeps its list, its records, its place in the nav and its search results. `first` names where the app opens: a place by its title or address word, a kind by its name or plural, or `"home"` (`openingOf`). The routed face opens there once, replacing the arrival so Back leaves the app, and the masthead still goes home; the scene opens on it when nothing else was asked (`openingView` in `@graview/react`, which the provider and the embed use). The arrangement travels on the view registry beside the places (`registry.arrange(pages)`, `registry.arrangement()`), set by `registerDeclaredLenses` and carried by `layerViews`, so every face that reads the places reads where they go. `graview check` names a kind in `order` or `hide` that is not there and a `first` that is no place, kind or home — `pages-kind-unknown`, `pages-first-unknown`, warnings at their paths — and `graview describe` says where the app opens, the order and what the home leaves off. Removing a kind in the document editor takes it out of `order` and `hide`, and renaming one renames it there. Unit tests compile a document that orders three kinds, hides one and names a lens first, and find it opening on that lens on both faces with the home in that order and the hidden kind reached by link and by search; `verify-declared` holds the same in a browser. The `graview-pages` skill says how. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-80.
  
  Compatibility: the declaration and check finding codes — additive within `graview-document@1`: `pages` was any object and is now one whose `order`, `hide` and `first` are typed; other keys are still accepted, so a document that compiled before still does. The new codes are warnings. The wire — `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-80`. Ops, stored formats and tool schemas are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- b5a4bfc: A host speaks in the app's own notices (FR-75). Graview Cloud said "a newer version is available", "offline — changes will be sent when you reconnect", "held while a repair is checked", a conflict with two choices and a refusal's sentence as elements of its own fixed over the app at `z-index: 1000`, in a copy of the framework's floating panel kept in step by hand. The embed's handle now has `notify({ kind: "toast" | "banner", sentence, tone?, action?, actions?, id?, timeout? })`, and so does `@graview/embed/pages`'s. It returns `{ id, dismiss(), update(change) }`. A toast goes by itself after `TOAST_MS` (six seconds; `timeout` says otherwise and `false` keeps it), unless it carries an action, when it waits for one; a banner stays until it is dismissed. A notice said under an `id` already showing takes its place. `tone` is `info` (the default), `good`, `warn` or `bad`, drawn as the notice's edge and dot in the theme's own colours. An action is a press (`onSelect`) or a link (`href`, `target`), the first drawn as the one the notice asks for, and either closes the notice; every notice has a dismiss control. Banners stand at the top of the picture and toasts at its foot, in the floating panel's look and the embed's scheme. Both are in the browser's top layer on the ladder's toast rung (FR-76), and are shown again over any popover of the family that opens after them (`raiseOverPopovers` in `@graview/react`). Each is said aloud as it arrives through a polite live region, and one whose tone is bad through an alert. `createNoticeBoard` and `Notices` in `@graview/primitives` are the board and its drawing: a React host drawing `<Embed>` passes `notices`, and the whole-page `Shell` takes a board as `notices` and draws it over its scene. This is the framework's reading of a request that arrived cut off at "the embed handle exposes `notify({ kind: "toast" | "banner"`": the sentence, the tone, the action, the id and the handle with `dismiss` and `update` are what the rest of that request most plausibly said, and `warn`, `actions` and `timeout` are added for Cloud's offline banner, conflict card and newer-build notice. A unit test says a toast, sees it said aloud and gone, keeps a banner past a minute and changes it in place, says a bad one as an alert, replaces one by id, presses an action and follows a link, and does it on the pages alone. `verify-chrome` says a banner and a toast through the handle on the embed's Graview face at 1440×900 and 390×844, in light and in dark: both are in the top layer, inside the viewport and on top at their middle, in the floating panel at better than 4.5:1, and said aloud. The toast stands over the profile opened after it, goes by itself while the banner stays and changes in place, a bad one is said as an alert, and a dismissed banner is gone. The `graview-embed` skill says to use it. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-75.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-75`, nothing else on it moves. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged. `EmbedHandle` and `PagesEmbedHandle` gain `notify`, so a host's own stand-in for either needs one.
- e811d26: A host's own actions are drawn in the profile menu (FR-72). Graview Cloud had nowhere in the embed for "Change the app", "Your apps" and "Report this app", so it kept them in a `<details>` menu of its own fixed over the corner of the scene. `mount(root, { hostActions: [{ label, href }] })` now draws them in the strip's profile menu, under who is signed in, in the order given: each a link (with `target` where it opens elsewhere) or, with `onSelect` and no `href`, a press; a press of either closes the menu. They are stops for the keyboard like everything else in the menu, which takes the keyboard when it opens (FR-77), and they are drawn in the embed's own scheme. `@graview/embed/pages` takes the same option, and so does the whole-page `Shell`; `HostAction` is exported from `@graview/embed` and `@graview/primitives`. A unit test finds the links in the menu of the whole embed and of the pages alone, in order and reachable, and a press that closes it; `verify-chrome` mounts the embed on a host's page with Cloud's three actions and reaches each by the keyboard alone from the profile button, on the Graview and pages faces, at 1440×900 and 390×844, in light and in dark, at better than 4.5:1 against the menu, with nothing of the host's fixed over the embed. The `graview-embed` skill says to put a host's furniture inside the embed, never over it. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-72.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-72`, nothing else on it moves. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged.
- 4e1d6e3: Every popover opens over everything, and everything else stands on one ladder (FR-76). On a hosted app the profile menu opened under the seat's rail and could not be read: each surface picked its own `z-index` in one stacking context, the profile and the problems 20, the rail 40, the altitude control 5, the zoom 8, a menu 60, the studio 100. Now the transient surfaces — the profile, the problems, the activity, the Find box's suggestions, the districts a row could not hold, a card's acts at the pointer, `ChatPanel`'s pill and the studio's own seat — are shown with `showPopover()` in the browser's top layer, which Playwright's Chromium, WebKit and Firefox all have: drawn over every rail, the scene and anything on a host's page, whatever `z-index`, `overflow: hidden` or `backdrop-filter` their ancestors carry, and still inside the element they opened in, so an embed's scoped theme reaches them and nothing lands on the host. In the top layer a pane is placed by what opened it (`useTopLayer` and `placePane` in `@graview/react`): under it, or over it where there is more room above, kept to the viewport, and no taller than the room it has, so what it holds scrolls inside it. Where `showPopover` is missing the pane stands on the ladder's popover rung. Everything that stays on screen takes a named rung from one ladder written once in `@graview/core` (`LAYERS`, `layer(name)`): scene, overview, rail, popover, dialog, toast, which `themeCss` writes on its root or an embed's box as `--graview-layer-<rung>`. The scene's ground is a stacking context of its own, so what orders its plots, cards, lines, figures and zoom (`SCENE_LAYERS`) can never climb over a rail. `POPOVERS` in `@graview/react` names every popover in the family with what opens it and its pane. A test reads every source file of every package and finds no `z-index` written as a number outside the ladder; `verify-chrome` opens every popover of the registry on the embed's Graview and pages faces and on the Shell, at 1440×900 and 390×844 with the seat open, and finds the pane in the top layer, inside the viewport, and under the browser's own `elementFromPoint` at its middle and at its last row. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-76.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-76`, nothing else on it moves. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged.
- e4f7b67: The seat's rail can be put away (FR-78). It took a column of the picture on every screen whether anybody was talking to it or not, and a hosted app's reader had no way to give the map the room. The companion's header now puts it away to a slim tab at the picture's left edge (`COMPANION_TAB`, 36 pixels), and the tab opens it again, by the pointer or the keyboard, which follows the control from the header to the tab and back; both say `aria-expanded`. Put away, the picture's box gives up only the tab and the provider's new `railLeft` (lent by the companion through `registerRail`) tells the layout the seat takes nothing more, so the city lays out into the room: `railInset(width, left)` takes it. The reader's choice is remembered per app under `graview:companion:<app>` in the host's `memory` or the page's storage, every read and write of it wrapped so a frame that refuses storage still works. Narrower than `COMPANION_OVERLAY_BELOW` (960 pixels) the open rail lies over the picture in the floating panel's look rather than taking a column, with the tab kept at the edge; on a phone it is the sheet along the bottom, as before. `mount(root, { companion: "open" | "collapsed" | "hidden" })` sets where it starts, and the whole-page `Shell` takes the same `companion` prop (remembered under the brand's name): the reader's choice wins over `"open"` and `"collapsed"`, and `"hidden"` draws no rail, no tab and no A-key door. The companion takes `start` and `rememberAs`; `CompanionMode` is exported from `@graview/primitives` and `@graview/embed`, and the provider carries `memory`. A unit test puts it away and opens it again with the keyboard following, finds the picture's box padded by the tab and the layout told, the choice kept and read back over the host's start, `"hidden"` drawing nothing, and storage that throws. `verify-chrome` does it from the keyboard on the embed's Graview face and on the Shell at 1440×900 — the scene's box is the frame's width less the tab, the city's first card moves left into the room, the choice survives a reload both ways — and finds the open rail over the picture at 820 wide with the picture all but the tab, and the host's `"collapsed"` and `"hidden"` starts. The `graview-embed` and `graview-agent-seat` skills say how. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-78.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-78`, nothing else on it moves. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged. `GraviewContextValue` gains `railLeft`, `registerRail` and `memory`, so a hand-built context value for a test needs the first two.

### Patch Changes

- a5daad4: A host's refusal is said in its own words, and an Apply with nothing changed asks the host nothing (FR-65). `onApply` could answer `{ ok: false, findings }` (FR-60), which the studio always headed "Not kept: the host could not keep this change. Your edits are still here.", so Graview Cloud said "Nothing changed in the studio." as a finding under a heading about failing to keep something. A verdict may now carry a `sentence`, which the studio says as its heading in place of its own; with one, `findings` may be empty or left out, and no empty list is drawn. Apply with nothing changed, or with every change taken back, no longer reaches the host: the studio says "Nothing to apply: the declaration is as the studio opened it. Change something, then Apply." and stays open. `Studio.unchanged()` reads that from the graph, not the history, so a change undone is no change. The applied panel's `data-applied` gains `unchanged`. Tests in `@graview/embed` hold the sentence as the heading with findings, with an empty list and with none, the studio's own heading where there is no sentence, and `onApply` not called for an untouched studio or one whose change was undone; `verify-studio` presses Apply in a host's page before any change and finds the host handed nothing, then finds the host's sentence heading its refusal. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-65.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — additive: `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-65`. `StudioHostVerdict` widens: a refusal may carry `sentence`, and with it `findings` is optional. A host whose `onApply` was handed an unchanged declaration is no longer called for it. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged.
- 94da01b: The embed's stylesheet keeps to its box (FR-64). `themeCss(scheme, brand, { scope })` put the tokens, the ground and the type on the scope, but every other rule was written for a whole page, so the `<style>` an embed renders still said `h1, h2, h3, h4`, `code, kbd, samp`, `button`, `button:hover:not(:disabled)`, `button:focus-visible`, `button:disabled` and `code` bare: on Graview Cloud's builder the host's own buttons below the studio took the framework's ink on a transparent ground and failed contrast in dark (3.41:1). With a scope, the finished sheet is now rewritten so every selector that does not already start at the box is under `:where(<scope>)`, inside @media and @supports too; `:where` weighs nothing, so each rule wins exactly the contests it won on a whole page, and only where it applies changes. The reader's motion answer is still asked of the document element and applied inside the box, and the registered `--graview-altitude` and the keyframes name no element. Without a scope the stylesheet is byte for byte what it was. A test reads every selector of every rule in the scoped sheet, in both schemes and two brands, and fails on any that could match outside the box; `verify-studio` mounts the studio in a host's page with the host's own `<button>`, `<h2>` and `<code>` below it and finds their computed styles the same as on that page with no embed, in dark and in light. The pages' gallery rule and the prose links' rule are keyed on Graview's own class and attribute, and the studio and the Shell bring no stylesheet of their own. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-64.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — additive: `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-64`. `themeCss` without a scope is unchanged; with one, the same rules in the same order, each held inside the scope. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 97f2a0a: A host that keeps the declaration says who is offered the studio (FR-59). `maySeeTheStudio` judges by the app's own policy, which grants the app's people, not its builders: on the vendors app only an owner or a planner may do everything, so an editor Graview Cloud had already let onto its builder was shown no studio, and Cloud's way round it was to hand the embed a store with the policy taken off. Now `StudioPlace` takes `offered`, and the embed's `studio` option passes it through: `true` or `false` is the host's word over the policy's, and a function `(store, principal) => boolean` decides from the store and the seat. Omitted, `maySeeTheStudio` decides as it always has. The app's policy stays on the store for everything else the embed draws. A test opens the vendors app through `mount(…, { studio: { onApply, offered: true } })` as a seat whose only role is `viewer`: the studio is drawn, and `handle.store.policy` is still the app's; without `offered` the same seat is offered nothing; `offered: false` withholds it from an owner. `StudioOffered` is exported from both packages, and `capabilities().shipped` names FR-59.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — additive: `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-59`. `offered` is a new optional prop and option; omitted, who sees the studio is unchanged. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged.
- 1e21d54: A host that refuses a change is heard (FR-60). `onApply` returned nothing, so when the studio handed Graview Cloud a change with `documentFindings` — one no edit says, which Cloud cannot preview — the studio still said "The checker is happy. Handed to the host to keep" while the page around it previewed nothing. Now `onApply` may return, or resolve to, `{ ok: false, findings }`: the applied panel says "Not kept: the host could not keep this change. Your edits are still here." with each finding's path, message and fix, the studio stays open, and its edits are untouched, so Apply again hands the host the same change. A promise is waited for ("Handing it to the host…"), a rejected one is a refusal in its own words, and an answer to an earlier press that arrives late says nothing. Returning nothing or `{ ok: true }` is kept, as before. The panel carries `data-applied` (`kept`, `asking`, `refused-by-host`, `refused-by-checker`) for a harness to read. `StudioOnApply`, `StudioHostVerdict` and `StudioHostAnswer` are exported from `@graview/studio`, and the first two from `@graview/embed`, whose `studio.onApply` takes the same type. A test removes vendor's `notes` through the studio's own actions strip in an embed whose host refuses: the refusal and its finding are shown, "Handed to the host" is not, the studio is still open, and the second Apply hands over `[{ op: "remove-field", kind: "vendor", field: "notes" }]` again. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-60.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — additive: `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-60`. `onApply`'s return type widens from `void` to `StudioOnApply`'s answer; a host that returns nothing is unchanged. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged.
- f1fcf13: A studio in a host's page draws no `<main>` of its own (FR-58). Graview Cloud's builder mounts the studio through the embed's `studio: { onApply }` into an element inside its own page, and the studio drew its picture in a `<main>` inside the embed's labelled section — so axe failed the host on `landmark-main-is-top-level` and `landmark-no-duplicate-main` whatever the host did, since a main inside the embed's region can never be top-level. Now `StudioPlace` takes `landmark: "main" | "region"`, and omitted it follows `within`: a boxed studio, which is every embed's, draws its picture as a region named "The declaration", and a page-filling one keeps its main. The embed's `studio` option takes the same `landmark`, for a host whose whole body is the studio, and its type is exported as `EmbedStudio`. A test builds a page the way Cloud's is (a header, a nav, its main, a footer), opens the studio in it, and runs axe's landmark rules and `region` over the whole document: nothing; with `landmark: "main"` axe reports the two rules Cloud did. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-58.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — additive: `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-58`. An embed's studio draws a labelled `section` where it drew a `main`; a host that selected the studio's `main` selects `[data-testid="studio"] section[aria-label$="The declaration"]`. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged.
- 826e19b: A hosted page carries 536 KB up front, not 1,075 KB, and each face of the embed is fetched as it is first drawn (FR-57). Graview Cloud's shell — `openRemote` and the embed over a document compiled in the browser — loaded every face before the app drew: the scene, the companion, the inspector, the routed face and its router, the chat and the agent's tool surface, and every default view. The embed imported every face outright, and a bundler splits a page by which files its first chunk can reach: the frame took its provider from `@graview/react`, its theme from `@graview/primitives`, and the provider took the reader's rung from `@graview/tools`, and each of those reaches the rest of its package. Now the frame — the region, the theme, the strip, the provider — is what a page loads first, and the scene, the pages and the picture are each a chunk fetched as they are drawn, with the framework's own views beside them. The frame reaches only the narrow entries `@graview/react/provider` (the provider, hooks and view registry without the scene), `@graview/primitives/frame` (the theme, the strip's Profile and Standing, and the framework's views behind doors), `@graview/tools/frame` (the reader's rung, pins and editable fields without the agent) and `@graview/layout/view` (the view state without the city); the routed face reaches `@graview/primitives/pages` and fetches the companion when "Ask" is opened, and a district fetches its arrange row when it is opened full. `scripts/verify-hosted-page.mjs` (`pnpm hosted`, first in `pnpm verify`) builds Cloud's page the way Cloud does and holds it to 600 KB up front and 150 KB of zod; it also says what each face fetches as it draws, 770 KB in all before the scene draws and 729 KB before the pages do.
  
  CI's bundle budgets follow: the pages face alone is held to 530 KB (from 950 KB) and the embed without the studio to 780 KB first loaded (from 1.2 MB); every face, loaded whole, is 11 KB smaller minified and 2.5 KB larger gzipped, its chunks each gzipped alone, so its gzipped budget is raised from 373 KB to 380 KB.
  
  Compatibility: the embed — a change of shape. `mount` returns with the frame on the page and the face on its way: its box stands empty (`aria-busy`) until the face's chunk arrives, and `handle.drawn()` resolves once the face asked for is drawn, after `mount` and after `setFace`. `preload(...faces)`, a new export of `@graview/embed`, fetches faces before they are drawn, and an embed mounted once its face is here draws it in the first commit, as before; with no face named, every face. `onReady` is told when the first face is drawn, not at the frame's first commit, and the new `onDrawn` option each time a face is. The framework's own views in an embed's registry are doors that draw them once fetched (`frameworkViewDoors`, `registerFrameworkViews`, `fetchFrameworkViews`, new exports of `@graview/primitives`); a host's `views` function is handed them as before. `@graview/react/provider`, `@graview/primitives/frame`, `@graview/primitives/pages`, `@graview/tools/frame` and `@graview/layout/view` are new subpath exports — each also exported from its package's main entry — and a product that aliases the framework's packages (a linked project's vite config, which `graview create` writes) aliases them ahead of the bare names. `@graview/embed/pages` is unchanged and still draws in the first commit. Ops, stored formats, the wire, check codes and derived tool schemas are unchanged.
- 5a2086e: A host whose page is the studio hands it in, and waits for no chunk (FR-63). The embed imports its own studio when it is first drawn, which is right for a page that may never open it and a round trip for one whose whole point is the studio: Graview Cloud's builder fetched about 109 kB before the studio drew. Now the embed's `studio` option takes `place: StudioPlace`, imported by the host from `@graview/studio`: the embed draws it in the render that mounts it, with the host's `onApply`, `landmark` and `offered`, and never imports its own. A flag (`eager: true`) could not do this, since what a bundler splits is decided by what the code imports, not by a value, so the studio is handed in instead. `scripts/lib/bundle-budget.mjs` reads which `@graview/*` packages esbuild's metafile leaves in a chunk the entry does not import outright, and a new budget, "embed with the studio handed in", fails when any `@graview/studio` module is in one (`lazyLacks`); `pnpm pack:inspect` holds it with the others. A jsdom test mounts an embed with a stand-in handed in and finds it drawn in the first render, and the embed's own studio never imported. The graview-embed skill says when to hand it in, and what `onApply` may answer. `capabilities().shipped` names FR-63.
  
  Compatibility: the wire — additive: `capabilities().shipped` gains `FR-63`. `place` is a new optional field of the embed's `studio` option; without it the studio is fetched when drawn, as before. Ops, stored formats, check codes and tool schemas are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- cc889f4: A typed app fits wherever an app goes, with no cast. A consumer's TypeScript met four walls that the framework's own code got past with `as never` and `as unknown as GraviewApp<AnySchema>`. `installation.mutations` would not spread into an app's mutations. A typed app was not an app: `GraviewApp<S>` would not widen to `GraviewApp<AnySchema>`, because an act's `apply` and `describe` and a rule's `evaluate` were function-typed properties, checked contravariantly — so the studio's readers (`graphToDeclaration`, `migrationBetween`, `sourceChanges`, `declarationFiles`), `createStoreHandler` and the embed could not be handed one. `schema.definition(kind)` on a schema whose kinds are only `string` was `never`. And an unbound `defineInvariant` handed its rule a `never` subject. Now `apply`, `describe` and `evaluate` are declared as methods, so a typed app and its acts and rules widen; `installation.mutations` spreads into any app's mutations; `definition(kind)` answers the kind's definition, any definition of that kind on `AnySchema` (`DefinitionOfKind`); an unbound rule's subject is a node of its kind (`NodeOfKind` on `AnySchema`), its fields `unknown` until bound; and `reachLens.View` is the generic view it always was, so it registers on any app. The casts are gone from the studio, the store handler, the embed, `@graview/core/testing`, the launcher and the example apps, and type-level tests hold each wall down.
  
  Compatibility: types only, nothing at run time changes. Every type is wider than before except one: `apply`, `describe` and `evaluate` lose `readonly` (a method cannot be marked so), so code that reassigned one is now allowed to, where it was refused. `DefinitionOfKind` is a new exported type. A call such as `syncConflictInvariant()` beside a typed schema may now infer `AnySchema` where it inferred the schema, and wants `syncConflictInvariant<typeof schema>()`. The wire, ops, stored formats and check codes are unchanged.
- 0fb76b7: An embed loads the studio when the studio is turned on, not before. `@graview/embed` imported `StudioPlace` outright, so every hosted page carried the studio — about 110 kB minified, 35 kB gzipped — including an embed mounted with `studio: false`, which never draws it. The studio is now imported with `import()` behind `React.lazy` and `Suspense`, inside the boundary it already drew behind: a product's bundler splits it into a chunk of its own, a page fetches it only when an embed offers the studio, and until it arrives the strip has no studio on it yet (a chunk that fails to load is said by that boundary, like a studio that throws). `scripts/inspect-pack.mjs` now bundles the embed split as a product's bundler would, and holds a new budget, "embed without the studio": what a page loads first, 1,175,514 bytes minified and 329,683 gzipped, budgeted at 1,200,000 / 337,000, which fails if any module of `@graview/studio` is in it. "Every face" — every chunk, studio included — did not fall: the studio now carries `compileDocument` to judge a document by compiling it (about 26 kB minified, 9 kB gzipped), and its chunk is gzipped on its own (about 2 kB and 3 kB more), so it measures 1,285,784 / 365,101 (1,259,216 / 354,049 before) and its budget rises from 1,290,000 / 362,000 to 1,310,000 / 373,000.
  
  Compatibility: `mount`'s options and handle are unchanged; the studio's button appears a moment after the embed does, once its chunk arrives, where it appeared with the first render. A bundler that does not split puts the studio back in the one file, as before. `StudioApplied` is still exported as a type. Ops, stored formats, the wire and check codes are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- f4a1f72: The seat is a labelled region, not a landmark inside one. The companion was an `<aside>`, a complementary landmark, drawn inside the Shell's main and inside an embed's own region, and the inspector, the line key and the quick relations were asides inside it, so axe's `landmark-complementary-is-top-level` failed on every hosted app at every size and scheme. The companion is now a `<section>` named "The seat — about …", with its h2 and every test id and `data-graview-*` attribute as before; the inspector, the key and the quick relations are named groups while they sit in the seat, and labelled regions where they stand alone. The profile and the activity panes, which open from the bar or inside an embed, are labelled regions too. A click on any of them still leaves the selection alone, and an embed still names each region inside it after itself (FR-40).
  
  Compatibility: the wire — additive: `capabilities().shipped` gains "FR-40", and nothing else on it moves. Ops, stored formats, the declaration and the tool surface are unchanged.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 55f8b27: An embed holds inside a chat's widget. `mount` takes `height: "auto"` and `onIntrinsicHeight`, and tells the host the height it asks for as it changes: the strip and the whole page on the pages face, the strip and the picture's box on the others. It takes `hostContext: { theme }` over the page's own scheme, and `scheme: "auto"` now follows the host page's `data-theme` and the system's preference as they change rather than reading them once. `pagesBelow` gives the scene and the Graview way to the pages face below a width. `remote` takes a store from `openRemote` and its presence. `memory` keeps the reader's settings and the tab's session where the host says, and a frame whose `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` throw still mounts. The routed face no longer asks for a window's height when embedded, which grew a frame sized from its content without end.
  
  Presence speaks one dialect and forgets the gone. `participantKey` and `parseParticipant` name the `kind:id:session` format the op log, the figures and the wire share. What a presence channel reports is dropped once its last word is older than `REMOTE_PRESENCE_TTL_MS`, whether or not the channel says the person left. A people directory (`people` on `mount`, `GraviewProvider` and the pages' context, `Person` in core) names authors in the rail, the pages, the profile and presence without offering anybody a seat, so a hosted reader sees no seat switcher and no "Sit as somebody else"; `nameOfAuthor` reads it after the seats. The handle gains `setPeople`, `setSeats` and `setHostContext` (FR-13).
  
  Compatibility: additive for the wire — `participantKey` writes the key the served store already wrote, and `openRemote` keeps the TTL it had, now named `REMOTE_PRESENCE_TTL_MS`. `EmbedOptions` gains optional `people`, `hostContext`, `remote`, `memory`, `presenceTtlMs`, `onIntrinsicHeight` and `pagesBelow`, and `EmbedHandle` gains `setPeople`, `setSeats` and `setHostContext`, which a host implementing the handle itself must now provide. Changed in meaning: an embed with `scheme: "auto"` follows the host's scheme after mount, and a figure's own name in presence is the one `nameOfAuthor` gives (a seat's label, a directory's name, `Principal.name`) where it was the principal's id. Ops, stored formats, the declaration and derived tools are unchanged.
- 6ea13f7: An embed knows what its host can keep. `mount({ studio: false })` leaves the Studio place off the strip, for a hosted reader who could change a declaration that would never be saved. `mount({ studio: { onApply } })` keeps it and hands the host what the checker passed (`StudioApplied`: the app, the migration and the files), asking after no dev-server door and writing nothing itself; `StudioPlace` takes the same `onApply`, and `useStudioDoor(null)` asks nobody. `@graview/embed/pages` mounts the routed face alone, without the scene, the lenses or the studio: bundled for the browser without React it is about 730 KB minified (195 KB gzipped), where every face is about 1.05 MB (300 KB). `node scripts/inspect-pack.mjs` bundles both and fails when either passes its budget, and a linked project's Vite config aliases the new entry (FR-19).
  
  Compatibility: additive — `EmbedOptions.studio`, `StudioPlace`'s `onApply`, `StudioApplied` and the `./pages` entry are new, and an embed without `studio` offers the Studio as before. `EmbedOptions` is now `FrameOptions` (exported) plus the scene's own options, with the same fields. Ops, stored formats, the wire, the declaration and derived tools are unchanged.
- a634594: An embed reports what went wrong and how long it took, without what was on screen. `mount` and `@graview/embed/pages` take `onError(error, { module, face })` and `onReady({ ms, face })`. Each face, the strip and the studio's place on it draw behind a boundary: what throws says it could not draw and offers to try again, and the rest of the embed keeps working, so a page that throws leaves the strip and the scene a press away. The host is told the error's class (`EmbedError`) and the framework module that caught it, never the message, which may quote a record. A view's own boundary in the scene reports the same way: `ViewBoundary` tells the `ErrorReportContext` above it, which `@graview/react` exports. `onReady` is told once, after the first render, how many milliseconds it took (FR-24).
  
  Compatibility: additive — `onError`, `onReady`, `EmbedError`, `EmbedErrorWhere`, `EmbedReady`, `ErrorReport` and `ErrorReportContext` are new, and a view that throws with no report above it is said on the console as before. Ops, stored formats, the wire, the declaration and derived tools are unchanged.
- The pages alone draw the app's views, and a view that throws on a page says so in its own place. `@graview/embed/pages` takes `views(schema, registry)` as `mount` does. Its pages draw from the same registry: the framework's defaults, the declaration's view specs, then the host's own (FR-35 on the pages-only entry). The pages face of `mount` gets the registry, the app's settings and presence through the same `PagesContent`. `mount` takes `heading` (FR-25) beside the frame options. On the pages, a lens or a kind's own group view that throws draws behind a `ViewBoundary`, as it does in the scene. The rest of the page keeps working, and the host's `onError` hears of it (FR-24).
  
  The pages-only bundle's budget is raised from 765 kB to 815 kB minified, and from 205 kB to 220 kB gzipped. The growth is the default views and view specs the pages now draw from: about 48 kB minified and 15.5 kB gzipped.
  
  Compatibility: additive — `views` moves from `EmbedOptions` to `FrameOptions`, so both entries take it. Ops, stored formats, the wire, the declaration and derived tools are unchanged.
- afcb06d: The workbench can be found by its headings. The seat, the inspector at the pointer, the activity and the places each open with a heading named as their landmark is, so a screen reader moving by headings reaches every region a person goes to.
  
  An embed's workbench says its name in a heading too. axe's `page-has-heading-one` failed on every embedded workbench in both schemes. `mount({ heading })` sets the level: `1` when the host's page is the app, `2` by default inside somebody else's article, and `false` when the host's own heading names it. The pages face has its own h1 and is not given a second (FR-25).
  
  Compatibility: unchanged for ops, formats, the wire and tools. `EmbedOptions.heading` is a new optional field, and an embed with no `heading` now carries an h2, which is not visible on the page.
- 570f9e2: A view registered once is drawn on every face, over the defaults rather than instead of them.
  
  - **The embed hands its views to the routed face.** `mount({ views })` used to build the pages face without the registry. A registered view was drawn in the workbench and never on a phone. The pages face now gets the same registry, with the app's settings and presence, so the gallery's card is the registered one × summary. The record page draws the kind's own one × full view under its heading (FR-35).
  - **Registering one view keeps the rest.** `views(schema, registry)` is handed a registry that already holds the framework's own view for every cell and the declaration's view specs. A function that builds a registry of its own is laid over those same defaults (`layerViews`), so one card no longer costs every other view. `<DefaultView {...props} />` draws the framework's own view for a cell inside a view of your own. On the record page, which is the default record, it draws nothing (`DefaultViewElsewhere`). `ViewRegistry.registrations()` lists every registration in the order it was made (FR-36).
  - **A member drawn as a row is a cell a view can claim.** When a kind has a one × glyph view of its own, as a component or a spec's `row`, two places draw it. A focused group draws each member as that line, each a target for its record. The list page draws each record as that line, with the whole line as the link (FR-37).
  
  The framework's own one-cell views are now marked as defaults (`isDefaultView`), the way its group views were, so a surface can tell them from an app's.
  
  Compatibility: the declaration — additive: `ViewRegistry.registrations()` and `ViewRegistration.across` are new, and a registry that implements the interface by hand needs the method. `EmbedOptions.views` is now called with a second argument, the registry to register onto. A function that ignores it still works, and is laid over the defaults instead of replacing them. Ops, formats, the wire and tools are unchanged.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b5e95a1: The first public release, 0.1.0, under the Elastic License 2.0.
  
  `graview` is the tool and `@graview/*` is the framework. The command line is
  its own package now: `npx graview create my-app` from nothing, and inside a
  project `graview check`, `graview docs`, `graview describe`, `graview lens`,
  `graview figure`, `graview serve` and `graview skills`. The `graview-serve`
  and `graview-skills` bins are gone — `serve` and `skills` are subcommands —
  and `@graview/core` no longer carries a bin of its own. A scaffolded project
  takes `graview` as its devDependency in place of `@graview/skills`, and
  `create-graview` (what `npm create graview` runs) depends on `graview`.
  
  Every package moves in lockstep from here, so the `^<version>` range
  `graview create` writes for each `@graview/*` dependency is always one that
  exists.

### Patch Changes

- ad8549a: A Graview in somebody else's page. `@graview/embed` mounts a declared app
  into any element — `mount(el, { app, seed, face, stop, principal })` and an
  `Embed` component — with the scene, the Graview or the routed pages as its
  face, a switcher and Standing above the picture, and nothing of the Shell.
  The store lives in memory and starts from the seed; the routed face runs on
  a memory router so the host's address is never touched; the brand's fonts
  are fetched by the embed.
  
  What the framework had to grow for that, and grew: `themeCss` takes a
  `scope`, so the theme lands on the element rather than on `:root` and
  `html, body`; the panes size against the picture's own box (`cqh`) rather
  than the viewport, and the Shell's scene region is that container, so a
  pane never reaches past the picture it belongs to, on a page or in an
  embed the size of a paragraph.
- e0d5026: A kit for the picture. Everything the scene draws that is not a view — the lines, their captions, the ground's grid and lattice, the kind tags, how far the unlit recedes, the mark a broken rule leaves — is declared on `brand.kit`, any part of it, the rest as shipped. A connector's route is a named strategy (`curve`, `straight`, `orthogonal`) and its stroke a named pattern; each is one case in one file, so the next is one more case and nothing in the scene moves. Colour and visibility are per edge kind under `connectors.byEdge` or for all under `connectors.all`; a kind kept quiet is not drawn and stays selectable from the inspector. `themeCss` emits the kit as `--graview-kit-*` custom properties that the ground and the tags read. `graview check` holds an explicit line colour to 3:1 against both grounds in both schemes (`kit-contrast-below-aa`, `kit-colour-unreadable`). An embed's handle gains `setBrand`, so a page can re-dress a running Graview.
- fc024d0: A lens chooses its shape by the room it has, and a narrow embed keeps its room for the picture.
  
  The coverage matrix's 316px label column put every column past the edge of a phone-width card, behind a sideways scroll nothing announced — names and no cells. The names now take a share of the width, and where the columns still would not fit at a fingertip each the matrix stacks: each row is its name and then its cells as labelled marks that wrap. Seven day columns in a 300px box were 40px cells with three letters in them; below about 44px a column a run of days is drawn as the agenda, and coarser cells wrap into as many columns as the width holds. The calendar's six range chips become one select when the card is narrow.
  
  The scene kept a fifth of a 360px embed clear for rails it does not draw there, and the layout took six gaps more off a focused card: a lens got 145 pixels. Below a phone's width the rails are gone and the focus margin is capped at a tenth of the span. The embed's strip, whose place and seat pills wrapped to five rows, shows the places and the seats as one select each when it is narrow.
  
  And the example's season and rotation calendars, declared on the chapters and never handed to the views, are drawn on the pages that explain them.
- e165c5b: A titled group view is a place. `register(kind, cell, view, { title })` names it; `views.places()` lists the names; the shell's bar and the embed strip show them as pills, pressed while you are there, so a lens is somewhere to go by name rather than a picture that vanished when you clicked into a member. And the list page withholds a creating act the seat may not take — struck through, with the policy's own reason — instead of offering a form that refuses on submit.
- 923bbfa: A profile on the bar. `<Profile>` is the one place that answers "who am I signed in as" and holds what belongs to the reader rather than to the installation: their own record (where an installation is declared), the seat switcher, the settings, and the scheme. Settings are declared — `app.settings`, drawn by the pane, honoured by the provider, and checked: `graview check` refuses a setting nothing can apply, one with nothing to choose between, one that opens on an answer it does not offer, two that share a name, and a root font size that is not a length. `readerSettings()` is the two every app should offer (text size and motion); `applySettings` carries them at the edge so an app's two faces agree.
  
  Two bugs surfaced underneath. The theme set `font: 0.875rem` on `html, body` — so the ROOT's own size became 0.875 of the browser's, every `rem` in the framework resolved against 14px instead of 16, and the one place a text-size setting can live was already occupied. The body is sized now; the root is left exactly as the reader has it, and "As your browser has it" stamps nothing rather than guessing. And `usePickTargets` stamped `role="button"` on every pick target including landmark elements, which ARIA forbids — three `<header role="button">` on the first screen of the demo, unnoticed because nothing had run axe over the scene. The role is now stamped only where it is legal; a target that cannot take it still gets `tabindex`. Motion is overridable by the reader: the stylesheet's reduced-motion rules are emitted once for the system's preference and once for `data-graview-motion="reduce"`, scoped so an embed honours a host's answer without restyling the host.
- e695209: A project can mount itself. `EmbedOptions.views` was typed as the erased return of `registerDefaultViews`, so passing the registry an app wrote for its own declaration — the only thing the option is for — was a type error; it is typed to the app's schema now. And a scaffolded project gains `@graview/embed` as a dependency, its dev alias, and an `embed.html` + `src/embed.tsx` to put one in, so the last rung of the pages skill is something a new project can actually climb.
- cb3fd21: `<Embed>` keeps the store it made when another seat sits down. Handed no store of its own, it built one from the declaration and the seed, and rebuilt it whenever the principal changed — the principal was in the memo's dependencies, and was handed to a `Store` that takes no such option — so a React host that changed seats lost every edit and the history with them. Who is at the keyboard is the provider's business; the store stays.
- 2cc27e9: Another seat's work is named by the seat's name. `nameOfAuthor(author, { graph, schema, seats })` reads the user node, else the seat the principal was offered under, else the id; the activity rail, the profile, and the routed face's history use it, and `PageContext` carries `seats` (the embed hands its own over). An app with seats and no installation read "user-lena" and "U user-june".
- 1272c12: An embed can offer seats. `seats: [{ label, principal }]` puts them on the strip, pressed while at the keyboard, and `handle.setSeat(principal)` changes who sits without touching the store or its history. The strip, the pages and the acts all narrow to the seat, so a policy is something a reader feels rather than reads about: sit down as the gardener and what only the coordinator may do is struck through.
- e809183: An embed's stop may name a place. `#view=the-season` is the link a page can write — `placeHref` spells it — and the scene's URL sync has resolved it to the group the place is a picture of since it existed; the embed read its `stop` through `fromUrl` alone, so a host page saying `data-stop="#view=the-season"` landed at the default view with the place's pill unpressed. The embed resolves it now, on mount and when the stop changes through the handle.
  
  A board in a room with no height of its own is sized by its width. The board lens drove its size from the measured height of the room it stood in, which a scene band and a page region have; in a chapter embed on the docs site the panel sits in a column as tall as its content, so the room measured four pixels, the board came out six by four, and every slot on it was a four-pixel target. Below a height a board could be read at, it takes the room's width and lets its aspect give the height, which is what a board in a document is.
  
  The embed has a fourth face, `picture`: one named lens and nothing else — the place the stop names, drawn at full size over the kind's current members, with no bar, no rail and no standing. A page that is about a lens shows the lens, not an app with the lens somewhere inside it; three of those stacked on the docs site's lenses section were three windows with a calendar somewhere in each. `PlacePicture` in `@graview/pages` is the component behind it, for an app's own page that wants the same.
  
  The calendar's day grid and agenda list are keyboard stops. Given less height than their rows they scroll inside themselves, and a region that scrolls with no focusable element in it is one a keyboard cannot scroll at all; each carries the span's own name.
- 9b3a623: An embed is a region with a name. `label` named every landmark inside an embed and left its root a plain div, so on a host page the strip, the seats and the picture sat outside any landmark: a reader moving by landmark could not reach the app, and two embeds were indistinguishable at the top. The root is a `<section>` named by `label` now — or by the app's own name when the page does not say — and the scaffolded host page has the `<main>` the embed deliberately does not bring.
- a6f64b0: Every size the framework draws is the reader's to change, and a test says so.
  
  The text-size setting works by one number on the root element, which is why every size here is written in `rem` or `em`. A single `font-size: 10px` opts one control out of it entirely — and four of them had. Set to Largest, every name in the city doubled while the district's own "open" control stayed ten pixels tall, along with the "+N past" tag, the altitude caption and every `<code>` span. The profile's mark was an 18-pixel circle around a letter that had doubled, and the name beside it was clipped to "Nobody in p…" by a 220-pixel cap.
  
  All of it is measured now rather than asserted: a probe loads the app at the browser's own size and at Largest and diffs every box. What came back was fifteen boxes that never moved while the text doubled. The framework's are fixed — four stylesheet rules, the profile's mark and name width, and five sizes in an embed's own chrome — and a new test walks the source of every package a person installs and fails on a font size written in pixels, in either spelling. A list in a commit message is not a guard.
  
  The demos had the same bug in bulk and are converted too: the garden's own product design (28 sizes), the launcher, and Things' views. `apps/promo` keeps its pixels on purpose — a 1920×1080 video composition has no reader and no setting.
  
  A district's drawing now keeps up with its name. The drawing is sized as a fraction of its card, the card is laid out in pixels off the stage, and the nameplate is sized in `rem` — so at Largest a doubled name stood over a drawing that had not moved at all, a postage stamp under a headline. It has a floor in `em` now, capped at the card: a first cut without the cap overflowed and the drawings were sliced off at the bottom edge, a plot reading as a V rather than a bed.
  
  **What still does not scale, named rather than hidden:** the scene's card geometry. `graview-kind-card` is 230×97 at every text size, because the layout sizes cards as fractions of the stage in pixels while their text is in `rem`. Making the city itself grow with the reader means fewer districts fitting on the ring, which is a layout change with its own design decisions — worth doing, not worth pretending is done.
- c3c93ce: An embed does not say a landmark's name twice. It prefixes every landmark inside it with its own label, and a picture whose panel bore the same name — "The pipeline", in an embed labelled "The pipeline" — became a region called "The pipeline · The pipeline". A region of the embed's own name is the embed's region, so it is named once and becomes a group rather than a second region of that name.
- 7188978: The chapters on the page that explains Graview are the app itself: each of
  the twelve is mounted live by `@graview/embed`, from the same declaration
  and seed its photograph was taken from, with the scene, the Graview and the
  routed pages a click apart, and the site harness judges the page with all
  twelve on it.
  
  Putting twelve Graviews in boxes the size of a paragraph found what a window
  had hidden. The ring's nearest district ran past the bottom of a short
  canvas; rails reserved in pixels took a third of a narrow one; several
  embeds on one page carried identical landmarks, and a face written to own
  the document put a `main` inside the page's; the coverage grid's columns
  crushed to nothing in a narrow box; a link on the routed face was a line of
  text and not a target. So: the ring is only as tall as leaves that card
  whole; the rails are in proportion; an embed names its landmarks after
  itself and a page is a `main` only when it owns the document (`PageMain`,
  `context.embedded`); a coverage column is a fingertip wide at the least;
  and a page link is tall enough to press.
  
  Using the live chapters found four more, all fixed where they live: the
  inspector pane was fixed to the window and so opened at the page's edge
  over the host's navigation — it is positioned within the scene's own box
  now, and the pointer menu is clamped to it; a focused card in a box the
  height of a paragraph was cut across its own facts — a short canvas gives
  the focus more of itself; a line at altitude ran to a district even when
  the district was opened and drawing the very member the line is about — it
  lands on the member; and the dashed marks for a pinned or considered card
  were drawn around the whole natural box and the kind tag rather than the
  drawing. The embed's strip shows two faces, the picture and the pages,
  since altitude is the scene's own control.
  
  From altitude a focused GROUP shown by the framework's own list is its
  district, opened — the scaled list in the middle and the same names in the
  district were one thing drawn twice, and a reader said so. A group with a
  view of its own (a week, a board) keeps its scaled card, and then its
  district stays shut. The framework's own group views carry a mark
  (`markDefaultView`, `isDefaultView`) so a scene can tell. And a line's hit
  stroke now keeps out of the cards an end is drawn inside, so a line to Ravi
  never takes the click meant for June above him.
- e0d5026: The installation is in the graph. `declareInstallation({ roles, admin })` gives an app a user kind and an invitation kind, the acts on them — invite, welcome, revoke the invitation, remove, grant, revoke — as ordinary mutations the policy judges, a module drawn only for those who administer it, and a `self: true` grant so a person's derived edit is theirs on their own record and nobody else's. A module may declare `visibility: "admin"`; the store answers `mayAdminister` and `kindsKeptFrom` from the policy; the provider keeps such kinds out of the picture for a seat that may not see them and until the stop says `show=<module>`; the bar and the embed strip offer "Show the installation" to the seat that may; the pages list an administered module's kinds only for that seat. `reachLens` draws what each role reaches from the same `permits` the store refuses with. The checker counts derived acts and self grants when it asks whether a role may do anything.
- b7d3209: The keyboard always lands somewhere. When an act removes, disables or hides the control the keyboard was on — Escape closing a menu, a chip's × dropping the selection, Back taking the page away, "Send" while the answer comes — it lands on the nearest thing that still stands where it was, or on the same control when a re-render drew it again (`useTheKeyboardLandsSomewhere`, installed by `Shell` and `<Embed>`). The studio hands the keyboard back to whatever opened it when it closes, and a routed page that replaces another lands it on the new page's heading. Eight walk findings were this one rule broken on eight surfaces; the browser harnesses' watch found it on about forty more.
- daccd55: The studio is a place on the bar. `<StudioPlace app={...} />` opens the running app's own declaration — kinds, fields, edges, acts, rules, roles and grants as districts, "What the checker says" as a place, the ordinary acts to change them, the studio's own history and undo, and an agent seat that proposes a repair for a rule that names none. Applying runs `graview check`, refuses on errors naming them, and otherwise offers the files `graview create` writes as downloads. Offered to the seat that administers where an app declares something administered, and to whoever is here where it does not — so a scaffolded project has it on day one. `Shell` takes it as a slot (the studio already depends on the shell's primitives); the embed strip takes it boxed, so a studio cannot escape onto somebody else's page.
  
  `ArgShape` gains `{ type: "boolean" }`. Without it "Add a field", whose `required` is a plain boolean, was derived NOWHERE — the studio's central act, in the studio, unreachable because nothing could ask one question. The strip asks it as two buttons rather than a text field somebody has to know to type "true" into.
  
  And what the studio does not model, it no longer destroys: a kind's `display.labels`, `display.hide`, `fixed` and `fieldRoles` are carried from the checkout through both the declaration and the written schema, narrowed to the fields that still exist. A `display.format` is a function and cannot be written; the file says so where it finds one, and `WrittenFile.kept` names it, instead of losing it silently.
- e7151d4: The type scale goes up a step. The framework's own text ran from 9px to 12.5px at a 16px root — a scale built around a 12.5px body, which a person reading a product for an hour called small, and which was small. Body text is 14px now, small text 13, marks and captions 12, the smallest label 11, and headings a notch up with them. The cards the layout sizes in the reader's own unit follow: a district's floor is 148px rather than 132 so "COMPONENTS" in 14px capitals holds one line, the districts' row is a little taller, and a focused card may take 1200px of a wide screen rather than 1040. The companion and the quick relations keep to the rail's share of a narrow scene rather than standing over the picture at 1000px.
- 55c4151: The compiler says when code is unused (`noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`), and what it found is gone. `Occupants` draws the others and nothing else: its props are `width` and `whereIs`, the walking seat's pad, reach and pointer plumbing removed. `SceneProps`, `ResolvedViewProps` and `DoorProps` lose a type parameter nothing read, and `placeOthers` a `height` it never used. One `violationKey`, exported from `@graview/core` (no longer from `@graview/react`); one zod `unwrap` in core; the structure and invariant providers name a node the way its kind does, through core's `labelOf`, rather than by its `label` field alone.
- 6e8a02c: What the page taught the framework, folded back in. A board slot holds several occupants, each name its own target, and the bench lists only what is in no slot. The coverage lens reads its rows and columns from the graph, as the board already did, so no app wraps it to hand over the other kind. A titled registration names the picture. `focus=agg:plot` is a stop's short form for `aggregate:plot`. An embed infers its face from its stop and its scheme from the host page, and `mountWhenNear` mounts many embeds as a reader comes near them. The scaffold's views file says how a lens becomes a place.
- 59cef8c: Who is where. Other people stand on your map at the plot their stop focuses, in the audience row of the showing they are watching, with their robots beside them captioned as theirs and the thing they point at outlined in their hue — placed by each viewer's own `whereIs` from a presence payload that is never a pixel and never enters the op log. `PresenceChannel` has two implementations in ship: a BroadcastChannel between tabs of one origin, beside the browser adapter, and two routes on the served store folded into the poll the remote store already makes. A per-tab session fills `Author.session` on a tab's ops and its presence key alike. Clicking a figure follows that person until you move yourself or press Escape; sharing is a reader setting in the profile pane; an embed broadcasts nothing unless handed a channel. `openRemote` now carries `applyAll` and `undo` to the wire.
