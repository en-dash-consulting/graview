### Patch Changes

- d70f2d6: A form asks the question the act left open. `DerivedForm`'s node picker listed every node of the kind, ignoring the candidates the affordance had already narrowed — so a record's own "depends on" offered the record itself, and an act that hands something on offered whoever already had it. The derived record page now passes `affordance.open` through; a form with no act behind it (a rule's repair, a list page's creating act) still offers every node of the kind, which is the honest answer there.
- a10c8d0: A titled group view is a place. `register(kind, cell, view, { title })` names it; `views.places()` lists the names; the shell's bar and the embed strip show them as pills, pressed while you are there, so a lens is somewhere to go by name rather than a picture that vanished when you clicked into a member. And the list page withholds a creating act the seat may not take — struck through, with the policy's own reason — instead of offering a form that refuses on submit.
- b99fd51: A relation is captioned from the end you are standing on. A record page's connections section put the edge kind over the reading — so an owner's record said "Assigned to" above "What they are seeing to", which is exactly the backwards reading `graview check` warns about, and where a declaration had no words for that direction the two lines were the same string twice. The eyebrow says what is listed now — the far end's kinds, in their own plurals — which is true from either end.
- 6ecf8ec: A repair is an act, and a seat may not be able to take it. Both repair surfaces rendered a rule's repairs straight from the violation, without asking the store whether this principal may run them — so a narrower seat was handed a live button and met the refusal on submit, while the actions strip beside it had already struck the same act through. `Repairs` takes the principal now and withholds what it must, with the policy's own sentence.
- 3251440: A repair with a blank in it is an ask. The problems page and the record page rendered every repair a rule named as a bare button applying the violation's own arguments, so a repair declaring `missing: ["owner"]` threw "expected string, received undefined" into the console and told the person nothing. Both surfaces — and the scaffolder's record-page template — now use one exported `Repairs` component: one press when the repair needs nothing, the derived form when it still has something to choose, and a refusal said where the press happened.
- 5123cf3: The chapters on the page that explains Graview are the app itself: each of
  the twelve is mounted live by `@graview/embed`, from the same declaration
  and seed its photograph was taken from, with the scene, the Graview and the
  routed pages a click apart, and the site harness judges the page with all
  twelve on it.
  
  Putting twelve Graviews in boxes the size of a paragraph found what a window
  had hidden. The ring's nearest district ran past the bottom of a short
  canvas; rails reserved in pixels took a third of a narrow one; several
  embeds on one page carried identical landmarks, and a face written to own
  the document put a `main` inside the page's; the coverage grid's columns
  crushed to nothing in a narrow box; a link on the routed face was a line of
  text and not a target. So: the ring is only as tall as leaves that card
  whole; the rails are in proportion; an embed names its landmarks after
  itself and a page is a `main` only when it owns the document (`PageMain`,
  `context.embedded`); a coverage column is a fingertip wide at the least;
  and a page link is tall enough to press.
  
  Using the live chapters found four more, all fixed where they live: the
  inspector pane was fixed to the window and so opened at the page's edge
  over the host's navigation — it is positioned within the scene's own box
  now, and the pointer menu is clamped to it; a focused card in a box the
  height of a paragraph was cut across its own facts — a short canvas gives
  the focus more of itself; a line at altitude ran to a district even when
  the district was opened and drawing the very member the line is about — it
  lands on the member; and the dashed marks for a pinned or considered card
  were drawn around the whole natural box and the kind tag rather than the
  drawing. The embed's strip shows two faces, the picture and the pages,
  since altitude is the scene's own control.
  
  From altitude a focused GROUP shown by the framework's own list is its
  district, opened — the scaled list in the middle and the same names in the
  district were one thing drawn twice, and a reader said so. A group with a
  view of its own (a week, a board) keeps its scaled card, and then its
  district stays shut. The framework's own group views carry a mark
  (`markDefaultView`, `isDefaultView`) so a scene can tell. And a line's hit
  stroke now keeps out of the cards an end is drawn inside, so a line to Ravi
  never takes the click meant for June above him.
- a5a867e: The installation is in the graph. `declareInstallation({ roles, admin })` gives an app a user kind and an invitation kind, the acts on them — invite, welcome, revoke the invitation, remove, grant, revoke — as ordinary mutations the policy judges, a module drawn only for those who administer it, and a `self: true` grant so a person's derived edit is theirs on their own record and nobody else's. A module may declare `visibility: "admin"`; the store answers `mayAdminister` and `kindsKeptFrom` from the policy; the provider keeps such kinds out of the picture for a seat that may not see them and until the stop says `show=<module>`; the bar and the embed strip offer "Show the installation" to the seat that may; the pages list an administered module's kinds only for that seat. `reachLens` draws what each role reaches from the same `permits` the store refuses with. The checker counts derived acts and self grants when it asks whether a role may do anything.
- 5410e86: The garden grows to twelve chapters, and two of the new ones answer what a
  product needs most: the other face, customised, and a second lens.
  
  `@graview/pages` exports `pageStyles`, the face's own type and spacing, so a
  record page an app writes itself is still the same face rather than a copy
  that drifts. The garden registers the plot's page in its own words over the
  derived defaults, and `graview create` writes the same customised page for a
  new product's first kind — the routed face is derived, and any page of it is
  yours to replace.
  
  The board lens takes `fillFrom: "occupant"`, so a domain whose edge runs from
  the occupant to the slot — a planting grows-in a plot — binds it without
  redrawing its edges to suit a seating plan. The garden draws its plots where
  they lie and the empty bed is the picture.
  
  Layout reserves the rails in every mode now, left and right: the quick
  relations and the inspector sat on a full-width lens's title in focus, and
  the altitude control sat on a card's corner. Every card keeps to the span
  between them, and a test holds it.

### Patch Changes

- 4bd846b: The horizon, modules, selection-as-a-stop, the traditional face (@graview/pages), the intelligence seam, and the ship subpackage (persistence wiring, op-log-native migrations, export bundles, health).
- cfdad5a: The sample apps remember. `@graview/ship` gains a browser adapter — the
  same snapshot, log and version the file adapter writes, in `localStorage`,
  slotted into `openStore` unchanged with migrations included — behind a
  `@graview/ship/browser` entry that carries no `node:fs`. `openStore` now
  reopens a store WITH its persisted history (a `Store` accepts a snapshot
  and the log that led to it), applies the declaration's own policy, mints
  ids that cannot collide across sessions, and takes `fresh` to return to
  the seed. The conventions a page reads — `?fresh=1`, a driven browser
  starting fresh unless `?remember=1` — ship as `browserStartsFresh`,
  `forgetFreshParam` and `freshHref`. Primitives gain `StartFresh` and the
  activity popover says "Remembered in this browser" with the way back; the
  pages face takes `remembers` and says the same in its footer.
- 329da2e: The pages face reads like a product's own site, not a back office. The
  default shell, home, list, record and problems pages open with the thing
  itself — the installation's name and mark on a masthead, a front page that
  summarises what is here in the app's own declared words, lists whose
  members carry a line of their own facts, records titled in the display
  face with the kind's own description as the lede, relations captioned by
  the edge's declared words (an inbound edge by its `inverse`), and actions,
  forms and history receding beneath the content. Typography rides the
  brand's display and body faces at a real scale in both schemes; a kind's
  accent marks it on every page. `hueFor` — the hue thread every surface
  reads — now lives in `@graview/core` beside the brand that overrides it,
  re-exported by `@graview/render` unchanged. Every testid, route and
  parity derivation is as before.
