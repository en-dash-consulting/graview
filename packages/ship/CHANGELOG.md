# @graview/ship

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 4bd846b: The horizon, modules, selection-as-a-stop, the traditional face (@graview/pages), the intelligence seam, and the ship subpackage (persistence wiring, op-log-native migrations, export bundles, health).
- cfdad5a: The sample apps remember. `@graview/ship` gains a browser adapter — the
  same snapshot, log and version the file adapter writes, in `localStorage`,
  slotted into `openStore` unchanged with migrations included — behind a
  `@graview/ship/browser` entry that carries no `node:fs`. `openStore` now
  reopens a store WITH its persisted history (a `Store` accepts a snapshot
  and the log that led to it), applies the declaration's own policy, mints
  ids that cannot collide across sessions, and takes `fresh` to return to
  the seed. The conventions a page reads — `?fresh=1`, a driven browser
  starting fresh unless `?remember=1` — ship as `browserStartsFresh`,
  `forgetFreshParam` and `freshHref`. Primitives gain `StartFresh` and the
  activity popover says "Remembered in this browser" with the way back; the
  pages face takes `remembers` and says the same in its footer.
