# @graview/ship

What **every** deployment of a Graview app needs, hosted or self-hosted: one `defineApp`
declaration plus one persistence adapter is a running deployment.

- **`openStore({ app, adapter })`** — load what was stored, migrate it forward, fold it into
  a live `Store`, and keep the adapter current (every diff appends its operations and
  rewrites the snapshot).
- **`createFileAdapter(root)`** — persistence a person can read: `snapshot.json`,
  append-only `log.jsonl`, `meta.json` with the stored schema version. The core's sqlite
  adapter is the scale answer; this is the "where is my data" answer.
- **Op-log-native migrations** — a declaration carries `version` and `migrations`
  (`{ from, to, title, apply(snapshot) → primitives }`). Running one appends ordinary
  operations: authored `system · ship:migration`, stating intent, carrying their inverse.
  `graview check` refuses a chain with gaps or multi-version jumps before deploy time.
- **`exportBundle` / `assertBundle`** — the anti-lock-in shape: graph + attributed history +
  version in one JSON bundle, re-importable into any deployment of the same declaration.
- **`health(store)`** — coherence, not liveness: dangling edges, standing, sizes.

## The boundary

Anything **one** deployment needs lives here. Anything only the **operator of many**
deployments needs — tenancy, provisioning, deploy-to-URL, billing, fleet upgrades, the
builder UX — lives in the `graview-cloud` repo, which consumes this package the way any
customer would. If Cloud ever needs a private hook into the framework, that hook is a
missing public seam to fix here first.
