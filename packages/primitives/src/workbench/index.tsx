/**
 * The parts of an interface that are not about the domain.
 *
 * The household example's shell came to a thousand lines, and building a second app made
 * it obvious how little of that was about households: what is selected and
 * what can be done with it, whether the rules hold, what the agent just did
 * and how to take it back, how to back out of a view. None of that knows
 * anything about a week or a bid — it is derived from the schema, the
 * invariants and the op log, which is the whole premise.
 *
 * So it lives here, and an app supplies what is genuinely its own: a name, a
 * home view, and whatever seat it wants to give an agent. The second app's
 * shell is about eighty lines, which is the number the claim rests on.
