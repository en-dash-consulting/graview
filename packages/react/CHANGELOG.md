### Patch Changes

- 2e494a0: A card does not swallow a field's key. Making the view host answer Enter and Space meant it called `preventDefault()` before asking whose key it was — and the in-place title editor is a one-field form inside a card, which the browser submits on Enter by default. Renaming a record stopped committing: the field stayed open and nothing was written. A key from inside a real control is left alone now; the card's own marks are unaffected.
- 2a02849: A card is named what it says it is. Every view host is a `role="group"`, and a record's `aria-label` was its node id — so a scene showing "Buy milk" read "item:buy-milk" to anybody not looking at it. The name now comes from the declaration's own `label(node)`, the same string the heading, the chip and the crumb use; an id with no node behind it keeps the address.
- a5a867e: A kit for the picture. Everything the scene draws that is not a view — the lines, their captions, the ground's grid and lattice, the kind tags, how far the unlit recedes, the mark a broken rule leaves — is declared on `brand.kit`, any part of it, the rest as shipped. A connector's route is a named strategy (`curve`, `straight`, `orthogonal`) and its stroke a named pattern; each is one case in one file, so the next is one more case and nothing in the scene moves. Colour and visibility are per edge kind under `connectors.byEdge` or for all under `connectors.all`; a kind kept quiet is not drawn and stays selectable from the inspector. `themeCss` emits the kit as `--graview-kit-*` custom properties that the ground and the tags read. `graview check` holds an explicit line colour to 3:1 against both grounds in both schemes (`kit-contrast-below-aa`, `kit-colour-unreadable`). An embed's handle gains `setBrand`, so a page can re-dress a running Graview.
- a10c8d0: A titled group view is a place. `register(kind, cell, view, { title })` names it; `views.places()` lists the names; the shell's bar and the embed strip show them as pills, pressed while you are there, so a lens is somewhere to go by name rather than a picture that vanished when you clicked into a member. And the list page withholds a creating act the seat may not take — struck through, with the policy's own reason — instead of offering a form that refuses on submit.
- f579faa: A kind with a picture of its own is where "deeper" goes. From altitude, going deeper into a district exploded it into a ring of chips whether or not the app had registered a lens over that kind — trading a designed picture for the fallback it exists to improve on, while the card's own ◆ said the picture was there. A group with its own view now travels into it and leaves its district shut; a group without one opens in place exactly as before.
- d7ea1a1: Going deeper into a group card goes into the group. Double-clicking a shelf card or a district once focused the card's own id, which no layout resolves, so the scene emptied with the card's name in the URL. `withJackIn` in @graview/layout is the one reading of the gesture: a record zooms (and zooms back out), a kind card on the ground zooms into its group as a place, and a district at altitude opens in place and closes again. The scene's double-click and `useJackIn().enter` both go through it.
- 666cc05: The card itself answers the keyboard. A view host is a tab stop, and its key handler returned unless the key had landed on one of the view's own pick targets — so Enter and Space on a focused card did nothing. On a blank app that is the whole interface: one district, whose selection opens the actions strip, where the only act lives. Enter on a host now does what a click does, and Enter again on a card already selected alone does what the second click does.
- 5123cf3: The chapters on the page that explains Graview are the app itself: each of
  the twelve is mounted live by `@graview/embed`, from the same declaration
  and seed its photograph was taken from, with the scene, the Graview and the
  routed pages a click apart, and the site harness judges the page with all
  twelve on it.
  
  Putting twelve Graviews in boxes the size of a paragraph found what a window
  had hidden. The ring's nearest district ran past the bottom of a short
  canvas; rails reserved in pixels took a third of a narrow one; several
  embeds on one page carried identical landmarks, and a face written to own
  the document put a `main` inside the page's; the coverage grid's columns
  crushed to nothing in a narrow box; a link on the routed face was a line of
  text and not a target. So: the ring is only as tall as leaves that card
  whole; the rails are in proportion; an embed names its landmarks after
  itself and a page is a `main` only when it owns the document (`PageMain`,
  `context.embedded`); a coverage column is a fingertip wide at the least;
  and a page link is tall enough to press.
  
  Using the live chapters found four more, all fixed where they live: the
  inspector pane was fixed to the window and so opened at the page's edge
  over the host's navigation — it is positioned within the scene's own box
  now, and the pointer menu is clamped to it; a focused card in a box the
  height of a paragraph was cut across its own facts — a short canvas gives
  the focus more of itself; a line at altitude ran to a district even when
  the district was opened and drawing the very member the line is about — it
  lands on the member; and the dashed marks for a pinned or considered card
  were drawn around the whole natural box and the kind tag rather than the
  drawing. The embed's strip shows two faces, the picture and the pages,
  since altitude is the scene's own control.
  
  From altitude a focused GROUP shown by the framework's own list is its
  district, opened — the scaled list in the middle and the same names in the
  district were one thing drawn twice, and a reader said so. A group with a
  view of its own (a week, a board) keeps its scaled card, and then its
  district stays shut. The framework's own group views carry a mark
  (`markDefaultView`, `isDefaultView`) so a scene can tell. And a line's hit
  stroke now keeps out of the cards an end is drawn inside, so a line to Ravi
  never takes the click meant for June above him.
- a5a867e: The installation is in the graph. `declareInstallation({ roles, admin })` gives an app a user kind and an invitation kind, the acts on them — invite, welcome, revoke the invitation, remove, grant, revoke — as ordinary mutations the policy judges, a module drawn only for those who administer it, and a `self: true` grant so a person's derived edit is theirs on their own record and nobody else's. A module may declare `visibility: "admin"`; the store answers `mayAdminister` and `kindsKeptFrom` from the policy; the provider keeps such kinds out of the picture for a seat that may not see them and until the stop says `show=<module>`; the bar and the embed strip offer "Show the installation" to the seat that may; the pages list an administered module's kinds only for that seat. `reachLens` draws what each role reaches from the same `permits` the store refuses with. The checker counts derived acts and self grants when it asks whether a role may do anything.
- 5410e86: The garden grows to twelve chapters, and two of the new ones answer what a
  product needs most: the other face, customised, and a second lens.
  
  `@graview/pages` exports `pageStyles`, the face's own type and spacing, so a
  record page an app writes itself is still the same face rather than a copy
  that drifts. The garden registers the plot's page in its own words over the
  derived defaults, and `graview create` writes the same customised page for a
  new product's first kind — the routed face is derived, and any page of it is
  yours to replace.
  
  The board lens takes `fillFrom: "occupant"`, so a domain whose edge runs from
  the occupant to the slot — a planting grows-in a plot — binds it without
  redrawing its edges to suit a seating plan. The garden draws its plots where
  they lie and the empty bed is the picture.
  
  Layout reserves the rails in every mode now, left and right: the quick
  relations and the inspector sat on a full-width lens's title in focus, and
  the altitude control sat on a card's corner. Every card keeps to the span
  between them, and a test holds it.
- 992ac22: What the page taught the framework, folded back in. A board slot holds several occupants, each name its own target, and the bench lists only what is in no slot. The coverage lens reads its rows and columns from the graph, as the board already did, so no app wraps it to hand over the other kind. A titled registration names the picture. `focus=agg:plot` is a stop's short form for `aggregate:plot`. An embed infers its face from its stop and its scheme from the host page, and `mountWhenNear` mounts many embeds as a reader comes near them. The scaffold's views file says how a lens becomes a place.
- 22a4a6d: What you can press is what you can see. A view host is the box the layout gave it, and a view that sizes to its content fills only part of that; the invisible remainder was still a hit target, so a record read from altitude and pinned beside a district covered the district's open button with nothing and the button stopped answering. On the DOM path the host and the scaled natural box are now out of hit-testing and only the drawn content is in. The navigation harness hit-tests it.

### Patch Changes

- 37bb6af: The constellation says what it means: relations drawn at full strength from
  above the stack (where the lines are the content rather than an aside),
  receding when a kind is selected so its own relations stand out, and a derived
  `RelationKey` naming each edge kind with the exact stroke the scene draws.
- e38fe86: The generic full page is a document rather than a card stranded on a viewport:
  a real header, a centred column, a heading that is the whole thing rather than
  a truncated copy of the body, field names in words, and no value repeated
  because the heading already said it. The name is now the rename control.
- 80f859b: Fixes from a code review of the constellation work: a selection is resolved
  onto what is actually drawn before it is compared with a connector's endpoints
  (it blanked the whole Graview otherwise), clicking a kind card up there selects
  it, and the connector stroke treatment has one home so a legend cannot drift
  from the line it claims to show. `GraviewProvider` gains `initialSelection`.
  
  Also: a lens now gets the schema from the provider, so an optional field absent
  on one node is data rather than a binding error — one unplanned task used to
  throw for a whole view.
- 7cebca3: The inspector states a violation once: the message used to appear as an
  observation AND as the repairs' ⚠ heading, under a title that opened the
  same words — now the heading carries it (name-trimmed, since the title is
  right there) and the duplicate observation is dropped wherever the
  heading shows. Pinch is altitude: a trackpad pinch on the canvas rises to
  the Graview and descends from it, one discrete step per gesture, with the
  browser's page zoom kept out of it. The city reads better: an opened
  district is a proper panel (name and count on one line, roster under a
  hairline, the block fading behind), nameplates never wrap mid-word, the
  kind tag wears its kind's hue, the pinned mark hugs the drawn content
  rather than the layout box, and stand-in ties stay on the ground — from
  altitude the constellation already draws the district relations.
- 76792f1: The lines land. Selection ties used to aim centre-to-centre whatever the
  geometry: two drawings stacked in one column got a vertical straight
  THROUGH every row between them (whose 14px hit corridor then stole those
  rows' clicks), a tie between adjacent rows was silently dropped as too
  short, and the single-smallest-element anchor rule tied a 3.2-row dot to
  a 5.2-row label — or to a chip in the activity rail. Routing is now a
  pure, tested decision (`tieRoute`): stacked drawings stitch along their
  common right edge in the gutter, row-mates stitch over the top, and only
  clear air takes the direct arc. Anchors pick the CLOSEST pair among all
  of a node's drawings, chrome (inspector, activity rail, chat panel) is
  declared off-stage and never anchors a line, and a tie whose far end is
  only a stand-in — the kind's district, when nothing draws the node itself
  — recedes to a whisper and takes no pointer instead of crossing the scene
  at full strength five lines at a time.
- 23ab0fe: A relation between two members of the same kind is drawn as a loop in the
  Graview rather than dropped. The legend was counting `waits-for 3` while the
  picture drew nothing.
- a94d8f5: A mark says what it is about, chrome stops sitting on the scene, a full page
  is a place rather than a picture of one — and a pass over every screen.
  
  **The board.** It drew a slot and the person in it with the same warning tint,
  so a rule about the LEFT MIDFIELD position marked the midfielder standing in
  it — a picture asserting something untrue about a person. The disc now carries
  the slot's trouble and the name carries the occupant's, and a key names each
  mark with the violation message that put it there. Zone names moved out of the
  field into a rail beside it, because inside they were drawn at exactly the
  place a left back stands and read as "DEFENCELB".
  
  **The strip.** It floated over a scene laying itself out into the whole window,
  so selecting anything covered the row of kind cards; it now reports its
  measured height through `bottomInset` and the scene lays out into the space it
  actually has. It showed four actions out of fifteen behind "+11 more"; it now
  fills the row it has. It printed "Pay the deposit · task · \"Pay the deposit\"
  was due 2026-08-28" — the same four words twice in one line — and now trims the
  restatement while keeping the date.
  
  **Navigation.** The home crumb named the place you were standing in, so it was
  a dead control printed an inch above a panel whose own heading said the same
  words; it appears only once you have left home. Apps with a place switcher pass
  no home crumb at all, since the pressed pill already is one. Rising to the
  Graview moved in beside the other place controls instead of sitting at the far
  end of the bar among the buttons that do things.
  
  **The kinds plane.** Six kinds sharing a parent were fanned into six
  seventy-pixel slivers whose labels ran together and whose longest wrapped
  mid-word. At most two nest now; the rest keep their ranking and take their own
  slots. Siblings offset by 14% rather than 45%, so neither hides the other's
  label.
  
  **Legibility.** Connector captions may be wider than the run they caption and
  carry their own ground, so "attends a block, or rides along on a run" is no
  longer cut to "attends a block, or rides alo…" with a hairline through it.
  Coverage row labels and column headers are sized for the words apps actually
  write, and the header band is sized from the labels present rather than from
  the longest anyone might write. Chips, crumbs, editable values, legend rows,
  timeline moments and the dismiss control are all at least 24 pixels.
  
  **And a way to keep it that way.** `scripts/audit-ui.mjs` (`pnpm audit`) drives
  twenty screens across the four apps and measures what a photograph makes you
  squint at: cards drawn on top of each other, captions cut mid-word, controls
  under a fingertip, the same string twice, chrome covering the scene. A
  deliberate tuck states itself in the DOM (`data-graview-nested`) so a checker
  can tell it from a collision.
  
  **The capture path survives a pointer.** This was recorded for months as "a
  click crashes the renderer process", and that was a symptom. Bisected in
  Chromium 154: a plain hover over a captured view kills the process just as
  reliably, a click on the ground beside one does not, and selecting the same node
  from the keyboard does not either. What is fatal is the browser's own hit-test
  descending into a `layoutsubtree` canvas child. The hosts carry
  `pointer-events: none` on that path now, which costs nothing —
  `updateElementGeometry` does not redirect hit-testing in this build, so a DOM
  hit-test on a captured view was already returning where the element was laid out
  rather than where it was drawn, and `PointerRouter` was already supplying the
  right answer. `scripts/verify-capture.mjs` (`pnpm capture`) holds the claim in
  three parts: the pointer survives, a click still reaches the node it drew, and
  the keyboard still reaches the views.
  
  **An agent seat says what it would do, and goes quiet when there is nothing to
  do.** All four apps had the same forty lines of chrome around four different
  scripts, and the same three faults in every one: the button never said how much
  there was to do, it stayed live and silently did nothing once there was none,
  and a refusal from the store arrived as an unhandled rejection in the console.
  
  The coaching example's was worse than that and had never worked. It ran as a roleless
  agent against a policy that grants selection to the coach, so every press threw
  `Not permitted: select-player on a position — coach can`, changed nothing, and
  said so nowhere. A seat is an agent acting FOR the person sitting in it, so it
  now carries that principal's roles — which turns the bug into the demonstration
  the app was built to make: as a coach the button picks the team; switch to
  analyst and it is refused in the same breath the actions strip refuses it.
  
  The chrome moved into `AgentSeat` in the workbench, where the rest of the
  not-about-the-domain chrome already lives. An app supplies a count, the
  mutation it is really asking for, and the turn itself. `scripts/verify-seat.mjs`
  (`pnpm seat`) holds 17 criteria across the four seats: each states its count,
  each turn changes the graph, each goes quiet afterwards, none throws, and one
  policy narrows the seat as well as the strip.
  
  **The kinds plane became a plane of glyphs.** It took a fifth of the window to
  draw cards covering a tenth of it: 190 by 107 each, holding a name, a number,
  two clamped lines of prose and a row of dots. The comments admit where the dots
  came from — the card "was a name, a number and a great deal of empty
  rectangle", so something was invented to fill it. That is backwards. The
  description moved to the tooltip, the dots became a three-pixel proportion bar
  that says the same thing faster, and the band went from 19% of the height to
  11%. The focus got 84 pixels back.
  
  **The scene can be moved.** Pins have been in the model since the first commit
  — `ViewState.pins`, a round trip through the URL, `layout()` letting a pin beat
  the computed position — with no gesture attached to any of it. Dragging a card
  now sets one. Dragging the ground pans, which needed `ViewState.pan` to exist
  at all; it is view state rather than a camera held to one side, so it is in the
  address, it interpolates, and it comes back when someone opens the link. A move
  is an ADJUSTMENT of the stop you are on rather than a new one, so `useUrlSync`
  replaces instead of pushing and one drag is one history entry rather than
  sixty. The trail gains a "moved ×" crumb, and Escape takes it off before it
  takes anything else off. `scripts/verify-moving.mjs` (`pnpm moving`) holds ten
  criteria, including the one that matters most: a drag is not a click.
  
  Pointer capture is taken when the drag STARTS, not when the pointer goes down.
  Taken on pointer-down it redirects the compatibility mouse events too, so every
  click on an inner target was reported against the host instead — double-clicking
  a task opened its card rather than travelling into it, and `verify-navigation`
  went from 14 criteria to 2.
  
  **Selecting something no longer moves the picture.** Insetting the scene only
  while the strip was showing fixed the collision and bought a worse fault: every
  click reflowed the whole scene, so the thing you clicked slid out from under
  the pointer as its actions appeared. The room is reserved permanently and the
  strip appears inside it. A one- or two-row strip — nearly every selection —
  moves nothing at all; an unusually tall one still pushes rather than covers,
  because being tall is rare and being covered is never right.
  
  **A brand has a third axis, and the apps use all of them.** Palette and
  wordmark were not enough: with `brandFromAccent` deriving everything from one
  hex over a shared base, four apps looked like the same application four times
  in different colours. `Brand.shape` adds a corner radius and a density
  multiplier, emitted as `--graview-radius`, `--graview-pad` and `--graview-gap`,
  so a bid desk can be square and tight and a household planner round and roomy
  without a component knowing whose product it is. The display face now reaches a
  panel's title, which is the largest text on most screens — it had been reaching
  the wordmark and nothing else, because the stylesheet gives it to `h1`–`h4` and
  a panel title is a `strong`.
  
  Each app now declares a real typeface: Figtree for the checklist, Fraunces over
  a rounded sans for the household, a Plex face for the bid desk, a narrow grotesque for the club.
  Three of them had declared `ui-sans-serif` and `ui-serif`, which resolve to the
  same faces everywhere and so were no declaration at all.
  
  `verify-brand.mjs` asserted the literal string "Inter" — a test that passes for
  exactly one brand and fails the moment anyone rebrands, which is the opposite
  of the claim it exists to check. It asks the declaration now: whatever the
  brand put first in its stack is what the page must render in, the face must
  actually have loaded rather than fallen through the stack, the display face
  must reach the headings, and the shape must reach the pixels. Nine criteria,
  up from six.
  
  **Two bugs found by the survey while doing it.** A kind card's title and count
  had ended up inside the proportion bar's conditional, so a kind with no members
  rendered an empty card. And every shrink on the kinds plane is proportional —
  secondary at 0.74, tucked at 0.8 of that, tucked again by how many share a
  parent — so at a glyph-sized band the multiplications landed under the content
  and the cards clipped by four or five pixels. Proportion is right until it
  crosses the floor; there is a floor now.
- 4bd846b: The horizon, modules, selection-as-a-stop, the traditional face (@graview/pages), the intelligence seam, and the ship subpackage (persistence wiring, op-log-native migrations, export bundles, health).
- b156490: The garden is grown a chapter at a time, and photographed. The empty
  example carries seven chapters — one kind; a second kind and an edge; a
  rule as data with its repair; plantings and the horizon; a seat for an
  agent; the garden remembering; who may do what — each a real declaration
  with the seed it has earned and the stop worth a picture. `?chapter=N`
  opens any of them, `scripts/progression.mjs` renders every one in both
  schemes and records what it saw, and the docs and marketing page teach
  from those pictures rather than from prose that can drift.
  
  Taking the pictures found three things. From altitude with nothing
  focused, the Focus control did nothing in every app that opens from the
  city; it now descends into the selected district, or the first one
  declared. The altitude ring ran under the inspector's pane, so a district
  could be drawn where nobody could reach it; layout takes an `inset` and
  the scene reserves the left rail. And the empty example's custom plot view
  at full fidelity showed a large blank card where the generic view shows
  the fields and the caretaker; it now overrides only the summary.
- 77d1d4a: Permissions, brands and a publishable shape.
  
  - A `Principal` is an `Author` with roles, and a `Policy` of grants is enforced
    at the store — including on undo, which was a complete bypass.
  - A `Brand` declares name, logo, typography and both schemes, and
    `graview check` measures every text pair against WCAG AA.
  - `@graview/render` splits its WebGPU surface behind `@graview/render/gpu`, so
    the main entry no longer requires consumers to install `@webgpu/types`.
- 04eaefe: A declaration can now say how its fields read — hide an ordering key, label a
  field, format a stored value — and an edge can carry an `inverse` so it reads
  correctly from both ends. Booleans render as words. Chips ellipsise (the
  `text-overflow` never applied, being on a flex container). And `Backtrack`
  makes the browser's own back and forward visible, because an interface whose
  navigation is the browser's should not require knowing that.
