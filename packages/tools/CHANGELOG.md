### Patch Changes

- ec91236: A field you could set at creation, you can change. Every kind with
  settable fields no declared mutation writes gets a derived, titled edit
  act — `edit-<kind>`, "Change the drill" — registered by the store like
  any other: logged, undoable, judged by the invariants, and by the policy
  through the declared acts that already write or create the kind, so who
  may edit a drill is whoever may already retime or design one, with no
  second list. Opting out is `fixed` on `defineNode` — the field and the
  sentence saying why it never changes. Mutations can declare the fields
  they `write` (as `connects`/`severs` declare edges), and `editableFields`
  believes a declaration over the name-match guess: `finish`/`reopen`
  writing `done` stop being invisible, and a writer that takes no value is
  offered as its acts rather than a text box. `graview check` gains
  `field-without-writer` (a settable field the derived edit cannot reach,
  symmetric with `edge-without-severer`), `writes-unknown-field`,
  `fixed-unknown-field` and `fixed-but-written`; generated agent docs list
  the derived acts alongside the declared ones.
- 964d140: The DOM path is a citizen of every browser. The board no longer trusts
  `height: 100%` to transfer through `aspect-ratio` — Firefox and WebKit
  treated it as indefinite inside the panel's flex chain and collapsed the
  pitch to its border pixels, taking every slot's hit target with it; the
  width now comes from the same ResizeObserver measurement that decides when
  the board turns. The local-AI rung fails fast and says why when a browser
  has no WebGPU, and the chat header carries that reason instead of a shrug.
  The graview-new-app skill states the supported-browsers floor.
- 95cceb3: The menu scales. Past the fold a filter-as-you-type field appears in the
  inspector — it narrows the same derived list by label and why, Enter runs a
  sole survivor, Escape clears. `defineMutation` accepts `pinned: true` (the
  app naming its own act), a person can pin any offered action from the menu
  itself (kept per browser beside the intelligence config, outranking the
  app's), and a deterministic recency/frequency boost read off the op log
  ranks what a workspace actually uses ahead of what it never touches —
  decaying so the menu tracks the season. The bands stay inviolate: repairs
  first, destructive last; pins and usage only ever shuffle inside them.
- 87948ef: Code-review fixes. `edge-without-severer` is suppressed only when EVERY
  kind declaring the edge name says appendOnly — one kind's suppression no
  longer hides another's makeable-but-never-unmakeable relation. The usage
  boost stops counting acts the person took back: an op undone by a later op
  carries no weight (the old undo guard was dead code — undo ops have no
  mutation — while the retracted originals kept theirs). The action filter's
  Enter never runs a destructive sole survivor and shows it no ↵ promise;
  an empty-query Escape blurs the field so the product-wide back-out works
  on the next press. And the person's pins now reach the agent seats: a
  tool runtime's `derive` option can be a function, read fresh per call, so
  the strip, the pointer menu, the chat and the agent seat never disagree
  about the same acts.
- 0f9b0fd: Pins override in both directions, and the stars say whose they are. A
  person can now UNPIN an act the app's declaration pinned — the same star
  gesture demotes it for that browser and restores it — where before the
  star on a declared pin was a control that visibly did nothing. The
  person's pin draws in the accent, the app's in quiet body ink. And when
  the searcher is down to a sole survivor, the row says ↵ — the promise
  Enter makes, shown exactly when it holds.
- 4bd846b: The horizon, modules, selection-as-a-stop, the traditional face (@graview/pages), the intelligence seam, and the ship subpackage (persistence wiring, op-log-native migrations, export bundles, health).
- 77d1d4a: Permissions, brands and a publishable shape.
  
  - A `Principal` is an `Author` with roles, and a `Policy` of grants is enforced
    at the store — including on undo, which was a complete bypass.
  - A `Brand` declares name, logo, typography and both schemes, and
    `graview check` measures every text pair against WCAG AA.
  - `@graview/render` splits its WebGPU surface behind `@graview/render/gpu`, so
    the main entry no longer requires consumers to install `@webgpu/types`.
